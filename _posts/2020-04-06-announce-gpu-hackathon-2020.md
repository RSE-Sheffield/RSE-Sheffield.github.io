Following the success of our 2019 event,
the University of Sheffield and NVIDIA are pleased to announce that we will be hosting a 2020 GPU Hackathon
as part of the NVIDIA international GPU Hackathon Series.

This event will take place between **27 – 31 July 2020**,
most likely as an online event unless government restrictions around COVID-19 are significantly altered.

Prior GPU experience is not required,
as those selected will be paired with experienced mentors who will teach them how to
leverage accelerated computing in their own applications or further optimize their codes.

General-purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) potentially offer exceptionally high memory bandwidth and performance for a wide range of applications.
A challenge in utilizing such accelerators has been learning how to program them.
The hackathon is intended to help overcome this challenge for new GPU programmers and also
to help existing GPU programmers to further optimize their applications -
a great opportunity for graduate students and postdocs.
Any and all GPU programming paradigms are welcome.

There will be intensive mentoring during this 5-day workshop,
with the goal that the teams leave with applications running on GPUs,
or a clear roadmap of how to get there.
Each team will be assigned mentors from
universities,
national laboratories,
supercomputing centres,
industry partners and 
NVIDIA who have extensive experience in programming GPUs.

Given the current COVID-19 situation and the ambition to accelerate infectious disease and infrastructure modelling
it would be great to attract applications from teams who are keen to work with GPU experts to
improve performance and scalability of models in this area.

The call for hacking projects is officially open. Early applications are welcome.
The project leader should submit through the [Hackathon Program website](https://www.gpuhackathons.org/form/register?hackathon_which_event=226)

If you are interested in being a mentor then please contact Paul Richmond via `gpuhack-organisers@sheffield.ac.uk`.

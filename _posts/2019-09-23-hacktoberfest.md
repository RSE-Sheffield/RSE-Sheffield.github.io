[Research Software Engineering (RSE) Sheffield](/),
the [Sheffield Bioinformatics Core][sbc] and 
the [Sheffield R User Group][srug]
are organising a **series in of hackathons** during October
as part of [**Hacktoberfest 2019**][hacktoberfest],
a **global initiative to encourage participation in open-source software projects**.
Hacktoberfest is all about encouraging meaningful contributions to the open-source ecosystem
and Hacktoberfest meetups are **for beginners and veterans alike**!

We're hosting Hacktoberfest meetups in Sheffield every Tuesday evening in October.
These should provide a friendly, informal environment for **working on open-source software projects** and **learning more about**:

- Open source and the huge diversity of projects that you could contribute to;
- How to find projects, tasks and ways to contribute;
- Version control through git and GitHub;
- Programming and software development;
- Effective collaboration online.

As an added incentive if you make five contributions to open-source projects on GitHub during October you get a **Hacktoberfest t-shirt**!

## Introductory session

* 1st October
* 17:30 - 19.30
* [The Red Deer][red-deer] pub (upstairs room)

The focus of this session will be on using GitHub to explore and contributing to open-source projects.
Feel free to bring your laptop and follow along
to allow to get yourself set up, practice and get ready to contribute.

## Hacky hour sessions

For every subsequent Tuesday evening in October,
we've booked a room to explore Hacktoberfest projects together!

* 8th, 15th, 22nd and 29th October 
* 17:30 to 20:00
* Meeting room 1, [The Diamond][diamond], Sheffield.

If you don't have a University of Sheffield swipe card,
please [register here][diamond-pass] for
a pass for [The Diamond][diamond].

Come to as many sessions as you like,
stay as long as you can,
bring your friends!
If anyone gets stuck, there'll be others around to help.
There'll also be at least one member of the RSE team at each session
to help with questions and demystifying any open source jargon.

By the end, you'll hopefully have had an opportunity to
learn more about collaboration,
have contributed to an open-source software project
and have got the t-shirt to prove it!

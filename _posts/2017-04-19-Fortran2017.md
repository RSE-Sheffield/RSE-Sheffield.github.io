In February, the Research Software Engineering group hosted an ‘Introduction to Modern Fortran Course’ taught by EPSRC Research Software Engineering Fellow, [Ian Bush](http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=6006). The course material is available at [https://www.oerc.ox.ac.uk/introduction-modern-fortran-course-materials](https://www.oerc.ox.ac.uk/introduction-modern-fortran-course-materials).

During the day, Ian recommended a bunch of books (below)

We’ve been working with the University library and I’m happy to announce that all of these are now available to borrow. Search for them using the [University catalogue](https://find.shef.ac.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do)

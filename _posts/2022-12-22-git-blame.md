[Git blame](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-blame) shows who made changes to which line of code for a given point in
its history. This is useful if you are struggling to understand changes to a section of code as you can potentially
contact the author and gain some insight.

# Usage

Git blame works on individual files and so requires a filename, there are a host of options, for example `-e` prints the
authors email address `-w` ignores changes to white space and `-L 10,20` restricts output to the specified line
range. If you want a the blame for a specific revision then you must include the hash.

```bash
git blame -e -w -L 10,20 f923la git_blame.org
```



For more detailed information on the array of options refer to the [official
documentation](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-blame) or see `git blame --help`.

# Alias

Some people don't like the pejorative nature of the word _blame_. That's ok though, with a tweak to your configuration
its possible to use the alias _praise_ or simply _who_ instead.

```bash
# blame alias
git config --global alias.praise blame
git praise -L1,30 git_blame.org
# who alias
git config --global alias.who blame
git who -L1,30 git_blame.org
```


# Ignoring blame

Sometimes the case arises where you want to ignore blame. Perhaps the most common example is when an existing code base
has been [linted](pre-commit) to conform to a particular style guide. Looking at who performed these changes is not
informative and masks who made the changes and why.  Its possible to ignore specific commits on the command line with
`--ignore-revs <hash> <file>`, but it will quickly become tedious to remember to ignore all blame across multiple
commits. Fortunately you can save the commits to ignore to the file `.git-blame-ignore-revs` (along with comments) so
that they are stored. The full commit (40 characters) of hashes should be used.

```bash
# PEP8 compliance for module X
c00177a6121f86c001f338feff3280fd576fdbf3

# PEP8 compliance for module Y
db27fa5f18299ca631efc430512a3f358c2b154f
```

Now that you have the revisions in place to be ignored when reporting blame you can choose not to use it.

```bash
git blame --ignore-revs-file .gitblame-ignore-revs git_blame.org
```

...but this is tedious to remember to have to do each time and ideally others on your team should use this file too. You
can configure Git to use this file by modifying the local configuration. Make sure to add it to your repository so that
others can use it.

```bash
git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
git add .git-blame-ignore-revs
```

As of [2022-03-08](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/5033#discussioncomment-2318478) GitHub will also
[ignore commits in the blame
view](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/viewing-a-file#ignore-commits-in-the-blame-view)
that are listed in `.git-blame-ignore-revs` providing this file is in the root of your project folder.

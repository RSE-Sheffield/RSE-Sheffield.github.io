### [**Hacktoberfest**](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is back! a **one month celebration of open source software**, all about encouraging meaningful contributions to the open source ecosystem, **for beginners and veterans alike**.


We had a great time last year, hosting hacktoberfest sessions as part of the [Sheffield R Users group](/blog/sheffieldr-hacktoberfest/) and [Code First Girls](/blog/codefirstgirls-meets-hacktoberfest/) so we're doing it again!

We're **offering a range of sessions, open to anyone, in a friendly informal environment**, as a great opportunity to learn more about:

- open source and the huge diversity of projects available for contribution.
- how to find projects, tasks and ways to contribute.
- version control through git and GitHub.
- programming and software development.
- effective collaboration online.


#### Make five contributions to projects on GitHub during October and get a **Hacktoberfest t-shirt!**

## Sessions
### Introductory session
#### 2nd Oct. 5.30- 7.30 pm, [The Red Deer](https://goo.gl/maps/ZjcpEK2oY6D2)

We'll kick off with an **introductory session on open source** on the **2nd of October** at the [Sheffield R Users Group meetup](https://www.meetup.com/SheffieldR-Sheffield-R-Users-Group/events/254986012/). The focus of the session will be on **using GitHub to explore and contribute to open source and is not limited to R users**. Also note that there is a huge variety of projects available, many not involving coding at all (ie collaborative writing projects, training material development). So feel free to attend if your just curious about open source in general. 

### Hacky hour sessions
#### [**Room 3.15 (Meeting Room 1), the Diamond**](https://goo.gl/maps/hs685HH7cwx), **5:30 pm  to  8:30 pm**  
##### The University of Sheffield, 32 Leavygreave Rd, S3 7RD

For **every following tuesday evening of October**, we've booked a **room to explore Hacktoberfest projects together!** The room is booked on the following dates:

- **09 October**
- **16 October**
- **23 October** 
- **30 October** 

(If you don't have a TUoS swipe card, please register [here](https://goo.gl/forms/7npNfDJoTkZJe21E2) for a pass to the Diamond)

Come to as many sessions as you like, stay as long as you can, bring your friends! If anyone get's stuck there'll be others around to help. There'll also be **at least one member of the RSE team at each session** to help with questions and demystifying any open source jargon. 

By the end hopefully you'll have had an opportunity to learn more about collaboration, play around with something new and managed to contribute and get the t-shirt to prove it!

<br>

### Hope to see you there!

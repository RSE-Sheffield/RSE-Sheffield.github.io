Last year, I worked with Dr Marta Milo of the [Department of Biomedical
Science](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/bms) to develop a [new course that
taught the basics of Bioinformatics](http://opendsi.cc/bioinformatics/)
to biology undergraduates. Marta took care of the subject matter while I
took care of getting it all to work in the [Jupyter
Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) in [Sage Math
Cloud](https://cocalc.com/). I also gave crash courses in Jupyter, git
and SageMathCloud to support staff.

The course was a great success and demonstrated what can be achieved
when academics partner with Research Software Engineers to deliver top
quality computational teaching. My favourite comment from student
feedback was **The hardest thing ever, stressful, frustrating but very
rewarding.** -- welcome to my life!

This success has led to me being invited to departmental teaching away
days for subject areas that include a lot of computation in their
syllabus. The most recent of these was with the [Department of chemical
and biological engineering](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/cbe). I only had
ten minutes but managed to include an introduction to the Sheffield RSE
group, a quick demonstration of the Jupyter notebook, a discussion of
the benefits of using SageMathCloud instead of the local managed desktop
and the possibilities offered by this combination of technologies.

Sometimes, it's useful to be able to talk quickly!

Other discussions in the session I was involved with included a
fantastic overview of flipped classroom teaching by [Siddharth
Patwardhan](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/cbe/staff/academic/spatwardhan)
and some of the upcoming challenges and opportunities in the higher
education teaching sector by [Wyn
Morgan](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/staff/news/pvc-learning-teaching-wyn-morgan-1.453796),
Sheffield's Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Learning and Teaching.

Channeling my inner Ferris Beuller, **The world of research software
moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around for a while, you
could miss it**. It was a pleasure to show off some of my favourite
technology to the chemical and biological engineers and I look forward
to working with them all in the future.

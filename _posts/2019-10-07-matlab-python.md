A huge amount of research code has been written in [**Matlab**](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) (**Mat**rix **lab**oratory), a paid-for product from **Mathworks**, and the Research Software Engineering (RSE) team here at the University of Sheffield have recently had a few enquires about either getting some of this code to work with [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) or to translate it into **Python** altogether. I'm going to talk a bit here about the motivation for this and the technical strategies that we're thinking about using.
To be clear up-front, this is not a **Matlab** vs. **Python** tech-off. It mostly applies equally to if one were doing this the other way round.

Both **Matlab** and **Python** see a lot of use in universities. In my experience, **Matlab** is particularly popular with physicists and engineers. It has been taught to undergraduates and powerful toolboxes mean that it's possible to put together complex data analysis and simulation workflows with minimal coding. **Python** is increasingly being taught at an undergraduate level - as a general purpose language it's in some ways more versatile than **Matlab** which is really geared up for scientific and engineering applications. **Python** sees use in bioinformatics.

## If it ain't broke...

If you've got an application in **Matlab**, surely you can keep using, modifying and adding to it? No? Reasons?

*These reasons are all about scaling up (which is something a lot of research has to address when moving from a lab/academic context, not just software):*

- I can't afford to keep paying for the license.
- My target users don't have a license.
- I want to deploy my application in a container (let's say [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)) and I don't have a license to do this.

*These reasons are all about responding to new requirements:*

- I want to use a library/package/toolbox that's only available in a different language.
- I want to use a language feature that's only available in a different language.

There are plenty of instances where sticking with **Matlab** is absolutely the right call. And at no point is anyone saying that something shouldn't have been done in a certain way!

## Let's "fix" it...

So what are our options? Here goes:

### Re-write all of the **Matlab** code in **Python**

This is going to take a while depending on how much code there is. The first question here is: How much are we relying on **Matlab** toolboxes? These can do a lot of things that are not in base **Python**.  One can find out what toolboxes are used by a group of *.m* files using:

```matlab
[dfiles,products]=matlab.codetools.requiredFilesAndProducts(mfiles);
```

Where `products` is the list of toolboxes. This is a starting point to begin finding alternatives - e.g. **scikit-image** has some of the functionality of **Matlab**'s **Image Processing Toolbox**. Anything that is not available may need to be built from scratch.
It may be a good idea to carefully scope the project to ensure that the requirements of the new application are tightly defined. If the old application does stuff that's not required in the new one, that baggage can be left behind. Another consideration is whether to refactor / reorganise the **Matlab** code, depending on how it's been put together. If it's, for example, one continuous script lacking functions, it may be a good idea to organise it such that a 1:1 map can then be made between functions in the two languages. However, doing this might mean losing out on **Python** language features that are not available (or not generally used) in **Matlab**. To highlight these differences: **Matlab** leans heavily towards arrays, a variable type that is not natively supported in **Python** (one can, of course, use *numpy*).

### Call **Matlab** code from **Python** <br> (e.g. if we want to integrate our **Matlab** functionality into a new application)

If we decide we don't fancy completely re-doing our project, other options are available. One is to call **Matlab** code from within **Python** using the [Matlab Engine for Python](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html). We can do this kind of thing:

```python
import matlab.engine
eng = matlab.engine.start_matlab()
mla = eng.rand(1e3,'double')
mla_t = eng.transpose(mla)
```

In which we make and transpose a **Matlab** array, using **Python**.  However, if we try to change a **Python** (*numpy*) array into a **Matlab** array, we can't:

```python
matlab_array=eng.double(numpy_array) #fails
```

This may be a bit limiting - here's a [list of what's allowed](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/pass-data-to-matlab-from-python.html). 
However, there are a couple of potential ways around this - see [this post](https://bobturneruk.github.io/pymat.html). Or...

### Call **Python** code from **Matlab** <br> (e.g. if we want to use new **Python** functionality that's not available in **Matlab**)

We can call **Python** from **Matlab** like this, assuming it's installed correctly:

```matlab
my_numpy_array=py.numpy.random.rand(int8(1e4),int8(1e4));
```

Here I've made a `numpy.array`. Good for me. And in this context, I can turn it into a **Matlab** array:

```matlab
my_matlab_array=double(my_numpy_array);
```

This opens up the possibility of accessing **Python** functionality while leaving most of the code in **Matlab**. Some more detail on this [can be found here](https://bobturneruk.github.io/matlab_python_matlab.html).

## Now what?

The best approach is going to be very project-dependant, and may entail a mixture of what I've talked about, above. The RSE team can offer a range of levels of support for this from [code clinics](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/support/code-clinic/) through to complete translation between languages.

The team was recently asked to speak to a first year undergraduate Computer Science course with a view to introducing students to concepts in research software engineering, including some which they might use in their upcoming projects. The talk recording is embedded below, it starts at the beginning of the video and ends at roughly 55 mins. Alternatively, [watch on The University of Sheffield digital media platform](https://digitalmedia.sheffield.ac.uk/media/Methods%20in%20Research%20Software%20Engineering%20%20-%20Dr%20David%20Wilby/1_3dtqe94z).

The slides from the talk are built by the code in [this repository](https://github.com/davidwilby/ResearchSoftwareMethods/tree/DCS_May_2021) - which *hopefully* also demonstrates many of the principles of good practice from the talk itself.

They're also [available as a PDF](https://github.com/davidwilby/ResearchSoftwareMethods/releases/download/DCS_May_2021/presentation.pdf).

RSE Sheffield is hosting its first coffee and cakes event on **4th October 2016 at 10:00 in the Ada Lovelace** room on 1st floor of the Computer Science Department (Regents Court East). Attendance is free and you don't need to register (or bring coffee and cake with you). Simply call in and take the opportunity to come and have an informal chat about research software.

The event is a community event for anyone not just computer science or members of the RSE team. If you work on software development are an RSE or simply want to talk about some aspect of software or software in teaching then come along.

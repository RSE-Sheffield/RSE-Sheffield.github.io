## Research Software Engineer (Complex Systems Simulation using GPUs)

* Closes: 14th February 2020
* £31,866 to £40,322 per annum (pro-rata) (Grade 7) 
* Full Time

Are you interested developing world leading software for the simulation of complex systems on high performance computing systems?

A new position is available as a Research Software Engineer (RSE)
in the area of complex systems modelling using agent-based modelling
on emerging high-performance parallel architectures.
The overall goal of this post is to provide long-term software and development management
for the [FLAME][flame] and [FLAME GPU][flame-gpu] packages
that are used extensively within EPSRC and EU-funded research (e.g. [StriTuVad][strituvad], [PRIMAGE][primage]).

You will enhance the university’s capability and expertise in developing research software as part of academic research.
The RSE team in Sheffield which you will join is one of the first and largest in the UK.
It is led by an [EPSRC Research Software Engineering Fellow][pr-epsrc]
and is guided by a steering panel of senior university staff
who are committed to supporting the role of RSEs within the research community.

The position would suit either a Software Developer with experience working in an academic environment,
a self-identifying Research Software Engineer
or a Researcher with experience of software development to facilitate research outputs/impact.
Applicants should be excellent software developers with experience of writing performance-oriented code in C or C++.
Understanding of parallel computing techniques with some experience of accelerated computing with GPUs is essential.
Hands on experience of multi-core or distributed computing techniques is highly desirable
as is experience of working in an interdisciplinary environment.

You will be educated to PhD level in computationally-based field (or have the equivalent experience).

You will undertake software development and novel research into software approaches for simulation
and, as such, there is scope and funding provided to disseminate via national and international conferences and workshops.
Similarly, there is potential to collaborate with industry partners
(for example NVIDIA, EPCC, Archer, N8, Oxford eScience Centre and JADE facility, Intel, OCR).
The post, therefore, would be well suited to a developer with excellent communication and engagement skills.

We are committed to exploring flexible working opportunities which benefit the individual and University.

We’re one of the best not-for-profit organisations to work for in the UK.
The University’s Total Reward Package includes a competitive salary,
a generous Pension Scheme
and annual leave entitlement,
as well as access to a range of learning and development courses to
support your personal and professional development.

We build teams of people from different heritages and lifestyles from across the world,
whose talent and contributions complement each other to greatest effect.
We believe diversity in all its forms delivers
greater impact through research, teaching and student experience.

## Community Engagement and Training Officer (Research Software Engineering)

* Closes: 4th March 2020
* £31,866 to £40,322 per annum (pro-rata) (Grade 7) 
* Part-time

Are you interested in leading engagement and training for research software engineering within a nationally-leading Research Software Engineering (RSE) team?

We are looking for a (part-time) new member to our growing Research Software Engineering (RSE) team
who can help us build capacity in research software engineering best practice
and reproducible research more generally throughout the university's academic community.
By leading community engagement and training,
we aim to develop spaces, infrastructure and activities
that will support a vibrant and diverse community of practice.

With a PhD (or be close to completion/have equivalent experience) in computing or a computationally-intensive subject,
you will be highly passionate about developing robust software
and advocating good software development practises through collaborations and training/teaching.
You should have experience of advocating reproducible research/software engineering best practice
(for example test-driven development, documentation and version control)
and the role of RSEs through the development and delivery of training.
You should also have experience of running a portfolio of engaging events
for example through community building, collaboration, public talks or blogging.

You will be responsible for developing and coordinating the delivery of a comprehensive program of
both original and established training events
and other community and capacity building activities
(for example, hackathons, code cafes, meetups and seminars).
The events will take place in collaboration with the rest of the RSE team and partners in 
The University of Sheffield's faculties, 
departments, 
the Library and 
Corporate Information and Computing Services (CiCS). 
Responsibilities will include 
identifying appropriate topics and gaps in currently available activities and 
development of training materials appropriate for researchers from diverse backgrounds and fields of research.
You will also contribute to the development of tools and materials
that can support the codification and dissemination of community derived best practices in Reproducible Research
(e.g. community co-developed documentation, templates and checklists).

We are a supportive group that values further development of our members
and we support each other through the diversity of our members' skills and experiences.
We are also committed to exploring flexible working opportunities which benefit the individual and University.

We’re one of the best not-for-profit organisations to work for in the UK.
The University’s Total Reward Package includes a competitive salary,
a generous Pension Scheme
and annual leave entitlement,
as well as access to a range of learning and development courses to
support your personal and professional development.

We build teams of people from different heritages and lifestyles from across the world,
whose talent and contributions complement each other to greatest effect.
We believe diversity in all its forms delivers
greater impact through research, teaching and student experience.

In this blog post we will introduce Git and talk about some terminologies related to Git and version control in general. We will also introduce some resources that might be helpful to read or watch.

If you are new to the Git world, you might hear some words that sound very similar and sometimes confusing. Below are a few definitions that might be useful;

## What is the difference between **Git** and **GitHub**?
Git is a version control protocol and a tool that is effectively the reference implementation for interacting with repositories in that format. 
<!-- Git is a version control system that you can use to manage your source code history. -->
Git currently is the most popular distributed version control system. It allows you to have your own local repositories. You can work on your code without having access to the internet, for example, committing new versions, viewing logs and comparing versions. Git Graphical User Interfaces (**GitGUI**) such as GitHub Desktop, SourceTree, GitKraken are Git clients/tools. 

**GitHub**, **GitLab** and **Atlassian's BitBucket** are public hosting services for Git repositories with web interfaces and many common collaboration workflows for software projects depend on functionality provided by these services.
So they are not the same thing: Git is the tool, GitHub is the service for projects that use Git and it is built on top of Git. Git is installed locally while GitHub is hosted on a remote server e.g. in the cloud. 

**GitLab** is very similar to Github, however, it was initially designed with a built-in Continuous Integration (CI)/Continues Development (CD) tool. The Continuous Integration framework inside GitLab is ranked as one of the best tools out there, if not the best.

Previously, to use CI/CD with a Github repository would require a 3rd party tool such as Jenkins, however GitHub has now introduced its own built in CI/CD called **Github Actions**. Github Actions enable users to quickly automate tests (CI), and deploy (CD) code. If you are interested, very thorough explanation can be found [here](https://blog.codegiant.io/gitlab-vs-github-which-one-is-better-2020-d8ec7fb9542c).

Another distinction between GitHub and GitLab is that the software that runs on GitHub.com is not open source and it means that you can not have GitHub.com like services on your own infrastructure although GitHub enterprise offers a licence to deploy to your own servers, AWS, Azure or Google Cloud. However, GitLab is an open source project and you can install and run GitLab services on your own servers (only community edition is free). 

**GitHub Pages** is a static hosting service that auto-generates and commits HTML using Jekyll. Jekyll is a static site generator and GitHub Pages has built-in support for Jekyll. GitHub Pages can also directly take HTML, CSS and JavaScript files from a repositories on GitHub. More information can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#about-github-pages).

Back in mid-January three members of the University of Sheffield's
Research Software Engineering Team (me, [Mike
Croucher](/contact/alumni//) and [Tania
Allard](link://slug/tania_allard)) spent a week at a [Computational
Mathematics with Jupyter
workshop](https://opendreamkit.org/meetings/2017-01-16-ICMS/), hosted at
Edinburgh's [International Centre for Mathematical
Sciences](http://www.icms.org.uk/).

This brought together the many members of the consortium working on the
[OpenDreamKit](https://opendreamkit.org/) Horizon 2020 European Research
Infrastructure project. The overall aim of the project is broad (to
further the open-source computational mathematics ecosystem) so it was
unsurprising that the collective experience of the attendees was too.
The attendees generally fell into one of the following four camps:

-   Researchers interested in solving [Group
    Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory) and
    [Semigroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigroup) problems using
    the [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) software, some of which were
    involved with developing a [Jupyter
    kernel](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projects/kernels.html)
    for GAP;
-   Others interested in the [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/)
    computational mathematics ecosystem (which is particularly strong
    for computational algebra) and working on a Jupyter kernel for it;
-   Research Software Engineers working on interactive widgets,
    visualisation tools and workflow tools for
    [Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/);
-   People with experience/interest in using computational mathematics
    tools for teaching purposes.

The structure was different from conferences I'd attended previously:
for each of the five days we listened and debated presentations in the
morning then busied ourselves with [code
sprints](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2017-02-23-computational-mathematics-jupyter-sprint)
in the afternoons.

Correctness, sustainability and human fallibility
=================================================

Our own Mike Croucher kicked things off by asking [Is your research
software correct?](http://mikecroucher.github.io/MLPM_talk/) in which he
presented **Croucher's Law**:

> I can be an idiot and **will** make mistakes.

with the corollary that

> You are no different!

He argued, convincingly, that in our research we therefore need to put
in place safeguards to lessen the chance and impact of mistakes, and
proposed the following as partial solutions:

-   Automate (aka learn to program)
-   Write code in a (very) high-level language
-   Get some training
-   Use version control
-   Get a code buddy (Maybe an [RSE](/contact/)!)
-   Share your code and data openly
-   Use literate computing technologies
-   Write tests
-   Cite code

[Raniere
Silva](https://www.software.ac.uk/about/staff/person/raniere-silva) from
the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/)
followed on with a complementary talk on how to make computational
mathematics software more sustainable. He commented that odd numerical
bugs can easily creep in over time (e.g. differing floating point
behaviour between Python 2 and 3) but that we can maintain confidence in
software using version control, continuous integration, good
documentation, tutorials, knowledge bases, instant messaging and by
developing communities around the software we value.

[Alexander Konovalov](https://blogs.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/alexk/) then
talked about a particular case of making research software more
sustainable and portable: he's been using
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers to run
[GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/). This lead into a discussion on
whether Docker is a sensible solution for archiving/reproducing
workflows: will it be around in ten years' time? Those interested in
that particular issue might benefit from attending the forthcoming
[Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/)
workshop on [Docker Containers for Reproducible
Research](https://www.software.ac.uk/c4rr).

Jupyter: what is it and how can we diff/merge/test Notebooks?
=============================================================

We were then given what was pitched as a **'general introduction' to
Jupyter** but ended up covering much more ground than anticipated,
largely due to the speaker being [Thomas
Kluyver](https://twitter.com/takluyver), one of the core IPython
developers (who happens to have gained his PhD from the University of
Sheffield). Thomas talked about the most significant features (literate
programming environments; the power and versatility of using the browser
as a
[REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop);
Jupyter's client-server architecture) but also touched upon **various
tools and platforms that have built on Jupyter** including:

-   [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): a
    multi-user hub which "spawns, manages, and proxies multiple
    instances of the single-user Jupyter Notebook server". One of the
    University of Sheffield's deliverables for the OpenDreamKit project
    is to get this running on our own computer clusters so users dictate
    what resources (e.g. cores, memory, GPUs) they want when they start
    a single-user Notebook session;
-   [tmpnb](https://github.com/jupyter/tmpnb): a JupyterHub-like system
    for launching temporary single-user Notebook sessions in the cloud
    (which are each backed by a Docker container). tmpnb powers
    [<https://try.jupyter.org/>](https://try.jupyter.org/) (hosted by
    RackSpace), which allows people to briefly test out Jupyter without
    installing anything locally;
-   [binder](https://mybinder.org/): a tool for turning a GitHub
    repository into a collection of interactive Notebooks, configuring
    the required environment/dependencies using a Dockerfile, Python
    requirements.txt file or Conda environment file;
-   [nbgrader](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): a tool for
    distributing coding and/or free text Notebook-based assignments then
    automatically or manually grading them. This can integrate with
    JupyterHub;
-   [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): convert a
    Notebook to HTML/Markdown/PDF/scripts or a custom format (using a
    [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) template). It is used by
    [nbviewer.jupyter.org](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to create
    online static HTML views of Notebooks. nbconvert is also used by
    GitHub for rendering Notebooks;
-   [nbparameterise](https://github.com/takluyver/nbparameterise): Often
    you want design Notebooks to demonstrate/explore the impact of a
    small number of key variables. This project of Thomas's allows such
    variables to be set in the first code cell then the entire Notebook
    can be run non-interactively and rendered to HTML;
-   [jupyterlab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab): This will be
    the next iteration of Jupyter's UI: rather than exclusively
    displaying a terminal, Notebook or file editor in the Jupyter
    interface, instead a multi-tab and multi-pane interface allows you
    to view and interact with several of these things at once. It will
    therefore look and feel a bit more like Spyder/R Studio/MATLAB but
    this is no bad thing as all of those make good use of screen real
    estate provided by the wide monitors we all have these days.

Given the enormity of the Jupyter ecosystem and how quickly it has grown
it was great to hear from a core developer which related projects he
thinks are the most significant and interesting!

Next up, Vidar Fauske gave [this
talk](https://opendreamkit.org/meetings/2017-01-16-ICMS/talks/nbdime.pdf)
on [nbdime](https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a new tool for
[merging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_(version_control)) and
[diffing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff_utility) Jupyter Notebooks.
The backstory is that for some time we've been recommending Jupyter to
those wanting to start using Python or R in their research and we've
also been telling everyone to use version control but the diffing and
merging tools typically used with version control systems don't work
well with Notebooks as they

-   Operate on lines without consideration of whether a file has a
    nested structure (JSON in the case of Notebooks);
-   Base64-encoded binary objects in Notebooks are naively treated in
    just the same way as text;
-   No logic for omitting certain entities (execution counters; cell
    outputs) from version control (although the wonderful
    [nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout) can handle both of
    these cases when triggered by a [git
    hook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks)).

Ultimately visualising the differences between two Notebooks and merging
Notebooks in sensible, useful ways really requires that the tools that
perform these functions have some understanding of the structure and
purpose of Notebooks: **nbdime** has that awareness:

-   The major unit for merging/diffing is the **cell**, the line.
-   Input cell merging is string merging whereas
-   Cell outputs are treated as atomic: they match or they don't.
-   Execution counts are sensibly ignored by default.

nbdime provides a core library, plus command-line and browser interfaces
for diffing and merging.

Overall, I'm massively excited about nbdime for facilitating much
slicker Notebook-based version controlled workflows and hope it sees
widespread adoption and promotion by the likes of [Software
Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/).

![nbdime's nbdiff tool for viewing the differences between two Notebooks.](/assets/images/nbdiff-example.png){: .img-fluid}

Hans Fangohr then introduced
[nbval](https://github.com/computationalmodelling/nbval), a new tool for
**automating the valdation of Jupyter Notebooks**. This could give
researchers greater confidence in their workflows: **does a
demonstrative Notebook still give the same answers if re-run after
making changes to the Notebook's environment (e.g. the package
dependencies)?**

nbval, a [pytest](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/) plug-in, works as
follows: it creates a copy of a Notebook file, executes the copy in the
current Python environment, saves the copy Notebook with its new cell
outputs then compares the outputs of the two Notebooks. There are some
nice features to control the granularity of testing: flags can be set so
certain cells are run but not tested;
[regexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) can be used
to ignore oft-changing output strings (e.g. paths, timestamps, memory
addresses). Images and LaTeX can't be handled yet.

Again, I'm exited about this new tool: being able to package both
workflow documentation and regression/ acceptance tests as Notebooks is
a great idea. Note that at present both nbdime and nbval include
mechanisms for comparing Notebooks but are presently separate projects.
It will be interesting to see if there's any convergence in future.

Interactive widgets in Notebooks
================================

We were treated to two talks on the
[ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package,
which provides **Python and Javascript-backed widgets for interacting
with Notebooks** e.g. sliders for assessing the impact of model
parameters on trends in embedded [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
plots.

First, [Jeroen Demeyer](https://github.com/jdemeyer) introduced us to
the high-level `interact` Python decorator function and `interactive`
class one can use to control function inputs using a HTML+Javascript
widget. He then went on to explain how one can manually reproduce the
magic of these mechanisms: you instantiate some (typed) input widgets
and output widgets, add them to an on-screen container then associate
each input widget with a callback.

Next, [Sylvain Corlay](https://www.lpsm.paris//pageperso/corlay/) talked
about the ipywidgets ecosystem and the future direction of the project.
He mentioned several projects that have built on ipywidgets, all of
which sound exciting but none of which I'd heard of before this!

-   [bqplot](https://github.com/bloomberg/bqplot): a
    [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) alternative that supports the
    same API, uses custom ipywidgets and behind the scenes uses
    [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) for low-level drawing;
-   [pythreejs](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/pythreejs): this
    exposes the API of the three.js Javascript/WebGL 3D library to
    Python; this is a low-level API, not a Python plotting library.
-   [ipyleaflet](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet): a GIS
    plotting library that uses ipywidgets and the
    [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) Javascript library.
-   [widget-cookiecutter](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/widget-cookiecutter):
    a template for creating custom ipywidgets.

The current version of ipywidgets, released since the workshop, includes
some interesting developments: much more of the code is now written in
Javascript (actually Typescript) rather than Python so widgets state is
maintained in JavaScript-land: widgets can therefore now be rendered and
manipulated without a Jupyter kernel! See [this statically-rendered
Notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ipython/ipywidgets/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Widget%20List.ipynb)
on GitHub as an example. Another advantage of migrating the bulk of the
code to Javascript is that the widgets should be usable with kernel
languages other than Python such as R (once people have written
language-specific ipywidgets backends).

Separate to ipywidgets, we were also introduced to
[SciviJS](https://www.logilab.org/blogentry/8541176), a tool currently
being developed by [Martin Renou](https://twitter.com/Renou_Martin) at
[LogiLab](https://www.logilab.org/) for **visualising 3D mesh-based
geometries in a Juypter Notebook**. It uses also uses
[WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/) /
[three.js](https://threejs.org/) for rendering so is rather performant.
I can see some ex-colleagues in civil engineering really liking this.
Check out the [online demo](https://demo.logilab.fr/SciviJS/).

Numbas for online computer-aided assessment (CAS)
=================================================

[Numbas](https://www.numbas.org.uk/) is a open web-based system for
formative and summative maths and science tests. It is being developed
by [Christian Lawson-Perfect](http://somethingorotherwhatever.com/) from
the University of Newcastle's [Maths and Stats E-Learning
unit](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths-physics/outreach/elearning/#overview).
It's very different to teaching environments that use Jupyter (e.g.
[SageMathCloud](https://cocalc.com/)) as almost all the code is
self-contained HTML+Javascript that is run on the client (for
scalability and resilience) and it is for generating closed tests
(rather than open mathematical exercises). Looks very attractive and
intuitive from the user's perspective!

Christian also mentioned [Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/), a
site of projects wanting help on simpler tasks. He says it's a good and
simple way of getting less experienced developers involved with
open-source projects. As a project maintainer you upload some blurb
about your project and tell the site which GitHub Issue tag(s) indicate
smaller tasks that are 'up for grabs'.

Case studies of Jupyter usage
=============================

[Hans Fangohr](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~fangohr/) from the
[University of Southampton](http://cmg.soton.ac.uk/) reported on using
Python and Jupyter to encapsulate multi-stage micro-magnetism modelling
workflows: his team have been able to automate the generation of input
files and processing of output files for/from old but robust modelling
software ([OOMMF](https://math.nist.gov/oommf/)); Jupyter then further
masks away the complexities of running models.

[Mark Quinn](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/physics/contacts/mark-quinn)
then talked about the impact that [SageMathCloud](https://cocalc.com/),
an online teaching environment which uses Jupyter, has had on the
teaching of physics, astronomy and coding at the University of
Sheffield. He's been working with Mike Croucher to develop SageMathCloud
courses for the Physics department with the goal of introducing
effective programming tuition early in undergraduate Physics degree
programmes. He's now quite a fan of the used coding environment
(Jupyter) and SageMathCloud's courseware tools (chat facilities and
mechanisms for setting and grading assignments) but has now been using
it long enough to identify some challenges/issues too (e.g. students
getting confused about the order of execution of cells; students opening
many notebooks at once (each of which has a resource footprint).

Mark is involved with the Shepherd Group, who research the efficacy of
teaching methods and are based in the same Physics department. They've
recently been studying the impact of using the Jupyter Notebook to
undergraduate students who had and hadn't studied Physics at A-Level.
They tested students (at different levels of [Bloom's
Taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy)) before and
after teaching and concluded that the Notebooks were suitable for aiding
students, regardless of whether they had a Physics background. Hopefully
the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) can
lend their support to pedagogical studies of this nature in future.

Other talks
===========

I should note that there were also a number of other talks that focussed
on the [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) and
[SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) computational mathematics software
packages: I've deliberately not mentioned them here so as not to expose
my lack of understanding of group theory and semi-groups and also this
post is long enough already! See the [full
programme](https://opendreamkit.org/meetings/2017-01-16-ICMS/programme/)
for info on things I've neglected plus links to the presentations.

Coding Sprints (inc. Jupyter Interactions gallery)
==================================================

After lunch on each of the five days of the workshop we worked on
various coding sprints: some wrote a Jupyter kernel for GAP, others
worked on SageMath, whilst me and a few others started work on [Jupyter
Interactions](https://github.com/mikecroucher/jupyter-interactions).
This sprint was suggested by Mike Croucher: he thought it would be nice
to have a curated set of Notebooks that demonstrate how to use different
[ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to manipulate
various mathematical objects. Several of us wrote Notebooks while
[Christian Lawson-Perfect](http://somethingorotherwhatever.com/) quickly
put together a very nice [gallery-generating front
end](https://github.com/christianp/jupyter-interactions-site):

wish to submit your own Jupyter Interactions Notebook then please
[submit a pull
request](https://github.com/mikecroucher/jupyter-interactions/pulls)!

Culture
=======

This was the first time I'd been to a conference where the emphasis was
very much on sharing ideas and working together: the academic
conferences I'd attended prior to this had previously had an air of
competition about them. Looking forward to meeting up with the
OpenDreamKit gang again!

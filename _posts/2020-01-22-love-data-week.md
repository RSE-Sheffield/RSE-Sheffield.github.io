[Love Data Week](https://lovedataweek.org/about-ldw/) is an annual global event designed to 
**raise awareness** and **build a community** to engage on topics related to **research data management**, **sharing**, **preservation**, **reuse**, and **library-based research data services**. 

The [University of Sheffield's Library](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library) have organised several events for this year's Love Data Week (10-14 February 2020):

  * 11th Feb, 10:00 - 12:00: DDP workshop on *Looking after your Research Data*. 
    NB now **fully booked** but 
    [spaces available for subsequent sessions](http://ris.dept.shef.ac.uk/skills_seminars/listings/view/122)

    This workshop will help you to get the most out of your data by keeping it
    safe and secure, organising, describing, archiving and sharing it, and by
    augmenting it with pre-existing data from a variety of sources. You will
    have the opportunity to put what you learn into practice by starting a data
    management plan for your own research.

    Please note: this workshop will not include methods of data analysis or detailed advice on research ethics

    Recommended for: all non-final-year doctoral researchers. 

    The key aims of the training are:

      * to introduce the concept of research data management (RDM)
      * to give you an overview of the current context and drivers for managing data
      * to help you start planning how you will look after your own data
      * to give you some practical data management tips to start using straight away

  * 12th Feb, 12:00 - 14:00: [Data Management Plan drop-in session](https://lms.shef.ac.uk/index.php#STS)
  * 13th Feb, 12:00 - 14:00: [Data Conversations: Delving into data visualisations](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/data-conversations-delving-into-data-visualisations-tickets-89967480155) workshop.  

    Data Conversations are a chance for researchers and professional services
    staff to come together and discuss their research data and current issues
    in research data management. There will be presenters from across the
    University, as well as plenty of time to meet and chat with colleagues.
  
    Our first 'Data Conversation', to celebrate Love Data Week, will focus on
    the benefits and challenges of data visualisation for researchers.

    Data visualisations allow research to be more easily explored, evaluated
    and understood than by looking at the raw data alone. Visualisations can
    help communicate research to new audiences, highlight trends during the
    early, exploratory stages of a research project, and make sense of big
    datasets.

    Speakers will include:

      * Alasdair Rae (Urban Studies and Planning)
      * Colin Angus (SCHARR)
      * Charlotte Tomkins (History), Charles West (History), and Tom Stafford (Psychology)

    The Library, IT Services and the Research Software Engineering team have recently
    begun to develop new services to support data visualisation and there will be a
    chance for researchers to feed back on what services they would like to see in
    the future.
  * 14th Feb, 10:00 - 12:00: [Bring Your Own Data workshop](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/bring-your-own-data-workshop-tickets-89957440125).  

    
    Is your data a bit messy?
    Can't find that all-important file? 
    Looking for a better way to structure your data but not sure where to start?

    Come along to this Bring Your Own Data workshop in Love Data Week and get
    hands-on support and advice to get your data in order.

    The session will start with some brief introductions to best practice in
    managing and analysing your data from experts in the Library and IT Services. We
    will then spend most of the time working with you to organise and structure
    your data - so make sure you bring some data with you!

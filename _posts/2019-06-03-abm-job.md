Following on from [my previous post](/blog/ics-job/) about us recruiting for a new member of the RSE Sheffield team to work on a variety of projects,
we're also **recruiting for another new RSE role** for a specific project, [PRIMAGE][primage].

Within this [Horizon 2020][h2020]-funded project this RSE will be working with and developing **agent-based modelling software** (e.g. [FLAME GPU][flamegpu] (CUDA and C/C++)) for the purposes of modelling the growth of tumours. 

The post provides an excellent opportunity for research software skills development. You will actively support the wider community of research software developers and will be encouraged to represent the team in national/international activities. For example, current team members are/have been: 

- [RSE conference](https://rse.ac.uk/conf2018/) committee members, 
- [rOpenSci editors](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/06/22/new_editors/),
- [NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute accredited trainers](/training/deeplearning/), 
- [ARCHER champions](https://www.archer.ac.uk/community/champions/names/) and 
- [Carpentries trainers](/training/carpentry/)

**[More information / apply][job-ad]**

Do get in touch if you're interested in the role but have questions you'd like answering before you apply!

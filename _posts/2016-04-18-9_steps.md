I attended the [Software Sustainability
Institute's](http://www.software.ac.uk/) [Collaborations
Workshop](http://www.software.ac.uk/cw16) last month. This annual
workshop is one of the primary events in the Research Software
Engineering calendar and I highly recommend going to one if you are
involved in the development of research software in any way.

One of the things I worked on was a collaborative blog post called [9
steps for quality research
software](http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-04-05-9-steps-quality-research-software).
I also wrote an article about some of the work I do called [The accident
and emergency of Research Software
Engineering.](http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=5997)

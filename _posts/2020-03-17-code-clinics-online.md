In response to the need for increased remote working as a result of the current Covid-19 situation, we're going to be doing our [Code Clinics](/support/code-clinic) remotely using Google Hangouts for now.

Code Clinics remain a great way to get help with writing and maintaining code and with reduced physical access to labs, perhaps now is good time to focus on this aspect of research. **We can offer advice on working with and executing code remotely.**

We'll do our best to help with:

- Short scripts
- Complicated spreadsheets
- Version control
- Databases
- Jupyter notebooks
- R markdown
- Getting code onto HPC
- Debugging
- Performance problems
- Anything else vaguely code-related, if we can!

*Code Clinics from the RSE Team are part of a range of IT, maths and data support services run by the University of Sheffield for researchers. We will direct you to our colleagues if they're more a more appropriate source of help for a particular issue, and they will do likewise.*

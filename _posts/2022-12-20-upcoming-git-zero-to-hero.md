The RSE Team are pleased to announce three scheduled sessions of the increasingly popular [Git & GitHub through
GitKraken - Zero to Hero!](https://srse-git-github-zero2hero.netlify.app/). These courses will run over two consecutive
days in morning sessions from 09:30 to 13:00 on the following days.

* [Thursday 26th/Friday 27th January 2023](/training/workshop/2023-01-26-git-zero-hero)
* [Monday 6th/Tuesday 7th March 2023](/training/workshop/2023-03-06-git-zero-hero)

## What are Git, GitHub and GitKraken?

[Git](https://git-scm.com) is a system of version controlling your code. Think of it as a lab-book or doctors notes that
are taken as you progress through your work, recording conditions, saving what has worked and correcting what doesn't.

[GitHub](https://github.com) is a website that allows people to work collaboratively on version controlled code.

[GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) is a client for working with Git and GitHub that includes both a GUI (Graphical
User Interface) and a CLI (Command Line Interface)

## Who is the course for?

Everyone who writes code! If you write scripts to analyse your code in R, Stata or Matlab you would benefit from using
Git to version control your code and GitHub to share your code and make it open. If you write Python, JavaScript, C/++
code as part of a team in your research group you would benefit from using Git and GitHub to work together.

Getting started with these tools can be overwhelming but by taking this course you will be introduced to the concepts
behind them and how to use them effectively to not just version control your own work but work with others on the same
code.

The course material is available [online](https://srse-git-github-zero2hero.netlify.app/) if you want to take a peek and
the first half using Git and publishing web-pages can be worked through in your own time. The real benefit comes from
participating in the collaborative exercises in the second half where you work together on projects making Pull Requests
and resolving problems that arise.

If you've never used Git, GitHub or GitKraken or have only just started then sign-up and come and learn more about these
powerful tools.

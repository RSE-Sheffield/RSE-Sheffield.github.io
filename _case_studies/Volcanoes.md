  quote: "Having a RSE work on a project means that we can focus and concentrate on the scientific goals knowing that we have an expert in coding (software) to deal with that side of things ... we have certainly learnt more about the best practice of developing software and how to do so rigorously so there is a bit of a long lived legacy too. In short, in terms of software provision, we wouldn't have got to this level of technology readiness as quickly."

Longer description that gets put on the Projects page.
Should be 2-3 paragraphs ideally outlining broad details of project.

Compared to othe means of measuring volcanic SO<sub>2</sub> emissions, ground based cameras provide a high degree of temporal and spatial resolution.
However, their usage has been limited partly due to the cost of the instrumentaion. The UV PiCam system was developed by Wilkes et al. (2017) as a way of addressing this by using off the shelf components to create equipment that produces equivalent results while reducing the cost by an order of magnitude.

The RSE and DAS teams have contributed to improving both the hardware and software used as part of this project. RSE work on the software has improved its usability and robustness, and ensured that the results produced are replicable. Hardware work has entailed upgrading from the Raspberry Pi 3 to Pi 5 board, and enabling use of a different spectrometer.

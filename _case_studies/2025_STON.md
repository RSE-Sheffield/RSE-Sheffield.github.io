    RSE involvement in my project made it possible to build an image-visualisation tool, STON, entirely from scratch—something that had long been needed to handle the large volumes of microscopic image data in my research but which I never had the capacity to develop alone. The collaboration with the RSE team was extremely efficient, professional, and solution-oriented. Throughout the process, I also learned a great deal about programming best practices and working with Git. Communication was always clear and well-structured, making it easy to follow the project’s progress and contribute effectively.  
    
    STON is already helping me gain a deeper understanding of my research material, facilitating interpretation and pattern recognition in large datasets. Because the RSE team helped make the tool fully open source, it is adaptable to different research projects and has the potential to grow through community contributions. I would definitely recommend collaborating with the RSE team to any researcher looking to gain deeper insights into their data and enhance their analysis workflows.

Thin-section petrography is a widely used technique in archaeology for analyzing the composition of ceramic and stone objects, as well as investigating their production technology and provenance. This method involves studying these materials in thin sections mounted on glass slides under a polarizing microscope to examine their microscopic features. A critical aspect of archaeological study is the comparison and identification of patterns within these features across multiple samples. However, it is typically only possible to view one sample at a time under the microscope. As a result, this method relies heavily on visual memory and repeated observations, making the process inefficient and time-consuming, particularly when dealing with hundreds of samples.

STON is designed to address these challenges by enabling users to observe multiple photomicrographs simultaneously within a single, convenient interface. It facilitates detailed comparisons, clustering, and data recording, which is especially important in ceramic paste analysis. By allowing users to view multiple samples side by side, the software supports efficient sample grouping and evaluation of compositional characteristics.

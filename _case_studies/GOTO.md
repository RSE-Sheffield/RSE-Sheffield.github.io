GOTO (https://goto-observatory.org/) is a global network of robotic, wide-field survey telescopes designed to detect optical counterparts to gravitational-wave sources. Since 2023 four GOTO telescopes have been installed at two sites: GOTO-North on La Palma in the Canary Islands, and GOTO-South at Siding Spring Observatory in Australia.

The GOTO Telescope Control System is a custom software suite written in Python that automates the operation of the GOTO telescopes. It handles all aspects of telescope control from observation scheduling to hardware management. The system is designed to operate the telescopes autonomously throughout the night, maximising observing efficiency and ensuring rapid follow-up of transient events.

This project involves developing and maintaining the GOTO Telescope Control System, including developing new scheduling algorithms and ongoing optimisations and improvements. The GOTO Collaboration includes 10 institutions from the UK, Australia, Spain, Finland and Thailand, with ongoing operations funded by the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC).

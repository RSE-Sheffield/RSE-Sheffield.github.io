  "Modelling the UKs Electricity Demand is challenging due to inconsistent data coverage across the country.
  This project collaborates with industry partners to deliver modelled electricity demand profiles across the country and evaluates the trustworthiness of these machine learning predictions."

The energy system of Great Britain is decarbonising towards net-zero largely through increases in low carbon electricity generation. This trend is set to continue rapidly over the next decade. One key barrier that still needs to be overcome to enable effective planning and operations is automatic visibility of electricity demand at high spatial and temporal resolution (half hourly).

Our approach is to use a wide range of available electricity system monitoring data (small groups of smart meters up to network monitoring at substations and supply points) along with information about the occupancy demographics and building stock of different regions of Great Britain. Using these data we are building a sophisticated machine learning model that allows the estimation of electricity demand of any arbitrary building or group of buildings. Such a model could be used in energy system design, planning or operational forecasting for distribution network operators or national system operators.

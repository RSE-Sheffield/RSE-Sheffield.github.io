## University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Team Newsletter August 2021

Hi everyone! 

Welcome to the monthly newsletter from the [Research Software Engineering Team](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/) at The University of Sheffield.

Quite a lot of developments on **open research** this month with France's [Second National Plan for Open Science](https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/second-national-plan-for-open-science/) and the UK's [Research councils policy on open access](Research councils policy on open access) being published, along with a demo version of [Octopus](https://science-octopus.org/) - a new publishing model supported by UK Reproducibility Network, eLife and mozilla Science Lab. Closer to home, the University of Sheffield's Open Research Prize winner [has been announced](http://librarysupport.group.shef.ac.uk/libraryblog/2021/08/04/the-university-of-sheffield-open-research-prize-2021/) along with an [event to celebrate the occasion](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/celebration-of-open-research-at-the-university-of-sheffield-tickets-163679197887).

We aim to share our experiences and information of other communities for those using software for research. This newsletter collects interesting events and opportunities over the coming month. It also signposts to other resources that we find beneficial or interesting. You may find the content interesting if you are someone in research using software, are a person paid to develop software (like a Research Software Engineer (RSE)), or are somewhere in-between (a research developer).

To receive this newsletter as an email each month, please sign up to our [Google Group][rses-mail-list]. **Tell your friends!**

To suggest content for a future newsletter either complete [this short form](https://forms.gle/YyQiNjg79tXaLZHq8) or drop us an [email](mailto:rse@sheffield.ac.uk). We can’t promise that we’ll publish everything that’s proposed but we are keen to feature submissions from the research community at the University of Sheffield.

*All times are BST (UTC+01)*

### Training

#### At Sheffield

**FAIR<sup>2</sup>**

The [FAIR<sup>2</sup> for Research Software Training Programme](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/training/fair4rs/) has been developed
by the RSE, Data Analytics Service and Library teams and will be launched in October. An introduction to the programme
will be given in a [LunchBytes session 2024-10-22](../events/lunchbytes-2024-10-22.html). The full syllabus is now live on [MyDevelopment](https://mydevelopment.csod.com/ui/lms-learning-details/app/curriculum/06573f55-12e4-44f1-be4c-fac5ea9d6851) (requires login).

**Sheffield Bioinformatics Core**

The Sheffield Bioinformatics Core is pleased to announce a schedule of courses for the new academic year. These courses provide an introduction to the R programming language, Unix environment (required for the use of the University's High Performance Computing facilities) and also specific applications in RNA-sequencing.
You can now sign-up for these courses using myDevelopment (search for "bioinformatics"). Course charges still apply, and upon sign-up we will contact you for a valid grant code or cost centre. In-person attendance is encouraged, but online options are also available.

- Tues Nov 12th 1-4pm - Introduction to RNA-seq analysis (£32 for students and £40 for staff)
- Weds Nov 27th 1-4pm - Introduction to the Command-Line for Bioinformatics (£32 for students and £80 for staff)
- Dec 1st, 3rd, 5th 1-4pm - Introduction to RNA-seq analysis in R (£72 for students and £80 for staff)

Where multiple dates are listed, you will need to attend all dates. You can also find more information on these course on their website (https://sbc.shef.ac.uk)

#### Outside Sheffield


### Funding Opportunities

- [FAIR-IMPACT's 3rd call](https://fair-impact.eu/3rd-open-call-route-2-support-opens-30-sept), deadline 4th Dec, hopes to fund applicants in four areas
    - Managing data types, schemas and vocabularies and crosswalks for FAIR researcher related metadata (in partnership with FAIRCORE4EOSC)
    - Creating EOSC compliant interoperability policies based on the EOSC Interoperability Framework (IF)
    - Testing the trustworthy and FAIR-enabling repositories prototype
    - Implementation of a shared API for semantic catalogues

#### Jobs

Check for advertised RSE and RSE-adjacent roles at the [RSE society's vacancies
board](https://society-rse.org/careers/vacancies/).

### Community

#### Digital Research Practice Support Community

The DRPS community is a group for people that support researchers in carrying out research in the digital age. Meetings
are held monthly, with discussions around events, training and opportunities related to the field.

You can join the google group
[here](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/digital-research-practice-support-community-group/about) to
stay informed.

The next meeting is scheduled for 2pm on Wednesday 6th November 2024.

#### LunchBytes

[LunchBytes](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/community/lunch-bytes/) are short talks from the research community on research
software, data, and infrastructure.

Due to capacity within the RSE team, there was very limited LunchBytes content over the past academic year.
This should be changing soon, a new coordinator for LunchBytes has been found (Research IT's Farhad Allian), with a plan to reboot these lunchtime seminars in the spring semester.
 
More information will be coming out over the coming months, so keep your eyes peeled if you'd like to learn more about research software and associated practices, or share what you know!

### Support

#### Code Clinics

Why not come to a [Code Clinic](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/support/code-clinic/)? We're keen to help you.

Code Clinics are fortnightly supported sessions run by the RSE team and IT Services’ [Research
IT](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) team. They are open to anyone at TUoS writing code for research to
get help with programming problems and general advice on best practices.

At each session, members of the RSE and/or Research IT teams will be available to review code, advise, troubleshoot, and
suggest ways to improve your computational workflows.

#### Research IT HPC Drop In

HPC Drop-In sessions are providing assistance with HPC related user issues such as challenges in scaling an application
from desktop to supercomputer. We are considering extending the number of our sessions to two or three weekly. These
interactive sessions could provide a better interface with our users than our non-interactive ticketing system. These
sessions are advertised on the [HPC mailing list](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/hpc).

#### Research IT Consultations

Alongside the HPC Drop-In sessions, Research IT are also running one to one consultations to solve in depth user
specific problems. These consultations can be booked via our webpage. If you are interested please visit the following
link: <https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research>.

## Sheffield RSE Team

The Sheffield RSE Team aims to [collaborate](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/) with you to help improve your
research software. They can [provide dedicated staff](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/provision/) to ensure that
you can deliver excellent research software engineering on your research projects.

## Research IT

[Research IT](https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) directly supports research, both academic and
commercial.  We provide large scale HPC systems, advice on everything from statistics to ML to data pipelines and
training for both students and staff.

Working with academics, our staff are embedded within research groups on both long and short term engagements.

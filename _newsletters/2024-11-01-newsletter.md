## The University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Community Newsletter November 2024

Welcome to the November 2024 newsletter for the research software community at The University of Sheffield, featuring news, opportunities, events and training for you.

### RSE FAIR<sup>2</sup> 4RS Training Programme Launch!
This training curriculum offers a modular programme to support researchers in applying FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles and open research practices to their research software. The programme is aimed at researchers, including PhDs and postgraduate research students, who create code (whether a few scripts or something more substantial) as part of their research and who want to make their research more open by applying the FAIR principles to their software or simply want to become more confident in the research code they are writing.

The programme will be running over the next few months, check out for [more information](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/training/fair4rs/) or to [sign up](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/training/fair4rs/) for sessions!

In the first session which took place in October, our Head of Research Software Engineering, Romain Thomas, delivered a talk titled "Better software for Better research: Introduction to the FAIR2 for Research Software training programme". In this introductory talk we present what the FAIR principles are and why they are crucial to make your research more open. We give some initial hints on how to apply them to software and present the FAIR training programme that our teams have designed for the UoS research community.

The [recording](https://orda.shef.ac.uk/articles/media/Better_software_for_Better_research_Introduction_to_the_FAIR2_for_Research_Software_training_programme/27283239?file=49937889) of the talk and the [slides](https://fair2-for-research-software.github.io/Better_software_for_better_research/#/title-slide) are both available.

### Training

#### At Sheffield

**FAIR<sup>2</sup> 4RS Workshops**
- 2pm 8th November - [Software Lifecycle Planning](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/training/fair4rs/#software-lifecycle-planning): Learn how to make your software sustainable in the long term through lifecycle planning, management plans, licences and dissemination.
- 18th & 19th November - [Version Control](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/training/fair4rs/#version-control): The version control module has two distinct training sessions: one for beginners and one for more advanced users. The first introduces key version control concepts such as forks, pull requests and branches using Git, GitHub and GitKraken, then gives you the chance to get some hands-on experience with using version control in a research setting. The second session aims to help you develop a deeper understanding of how Git works to facilitate collaboration by improving your understanding of working with branches and how to make your commits tidier, as well as understanding how to effectively use pull requests and Git history.
- 9th & 10th December - [Software Design](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/training/fair4rs/#software-design): The way you write your code will have a massive impact on how easy it is to maintain. During this course we will learn how to create maintainable, readable and reusable code.

The [FAIR<sup>2</sup> for Research Software Training Programme](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/training/fair4rs/) has been developed
by the RSE, Data Analytics Service and Library teams and will be launched in October. The full syllabus is now live on [MyDevelopment](https://mydevelopment.csod.com/ui/lms-learning-details/app/curriculum/06573f55-12e4-44f1-be4c-fac5ea9d6851) (requires login).

#### Jobs

Check for advertised RSE and RSE-adjacent roles at the [RSE society's vacancies
board](https://society-rse.org/careers/vacancies/).

### Community

#### Digital Research Practice Support Community

The DRPS community is a group for people that support researchers in carrying out research in the digital age. Meetings
are held monthly, with discussions around events, training and opportunities related to the field.

You can join the google group
[here](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/digital-research-practice-support-community-group/about) to
stay informed.

The next meeting is scheduled for 2pm on Wednesday 6th November 2024.

#### LunchBytes

[LunchBytes](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/community/lunch-bytes/) are short talks from the research community on research
software, data, and infrastructure.

Due to capacity within the RSE team, there was very limited LunchBytes content over the past academic year.
This should be changing soon, a new coordinator for LunchBytes has been found (Research IT's Farhad Allian), with a plan to reboot these lunchtime seminars in the spring semester.
 
More information will be coming out over the coming months, so keep your eyes peeled if you'd like to learn more about research software and associated practices, or share what you know!

### Support

#### Code Clinics

Why not come to a [Code Clinic](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/support/code-clinic/)? We're keen to help you.

Code Clinics are fortnightly supported sessions run by the RSE team and IT Services’ [Research
IT](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) team. They are open to anyone at TUoS writing code for research to
get help with programming problems and general advice on best practices.

At each session, members of the RSE and/or Research IT teams will be available to review code, advise, troubleshoot, and
suggest ways to improve your computational workflows.

#### Research IT HPC Drop In

HPC Drop-In sessions are providing assistance with HPC related user issues such as challenges in scaling an application
from desktop to supercomputer. We are considering extending the number of our sessions to two or three weekly. These
interactive sessions could provide a better interface with our users than our non-interactive ticketing system. These
sessions are advertised on the [HPC mailing list](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/hpc).

#### Research IT Consultations

Alongside the HPC Drop-In sessions, Research IT are also running one to one consultations to solve in depth user
specific problems. These consultations can be booked via our webpage. If you are interested please visit the following
link: <https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research>.

## Sheffield RSE Team

The Sheffield RSE Team aims to [collaborate](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/) with you to help improve your
research software. They can [provide dedicated staff](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/provision/) to ensure that
you can deliver excellent research software engineering on your research projects.

## Research IT

[Research IT](https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) directly supports research, both academic and
commercial.  We provide large scale HPC systems, advice on everything from statistics to ML to data pipelines and
training for both students and staff.

Working with academics, our staff are embedded within research groups on both long and short term engagements.

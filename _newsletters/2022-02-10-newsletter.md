## The University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Community Newsletter February 2022

Hi everyone!

Welcome to the monthly newsletter for the [Research Software Engineering Community](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/) at The University of Sheffield.


### Code Clinics
Code Clinics are fortnightly support sessions run on alternate Wednesdays by the RSE Team and IT Services’ Research and Innovation IT (ITS R&I) team. They are open to anyone at TUOS writing code for research to get help with programming problems and general advice on best practice.

At each session, members of the RSE and/or ITS R&I teams will be available to review code, advise, troubleshoot and suggest ways to improve your computational workflows.

To find out more and book a slot [click here](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/support/code-clinic/)


### LunchBytes

[LunchBytes](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/community/lunch-bytes/) are a monthly series of short talks from the research community on research software, data and infrastructure.

We have LunchBytes sessions scheduled for February and March, save the date!

* **High Performance Computing (HPC) at Sheffield and Beyond, 17th February 2022 12:00-13:00**
If you find yourself running simulations that take days, struggling to fit datasets in your computer’s memory, training deep learning models or wish you had more computational resource for doing research, HPC might be the solution!

More details about the event are available [on our website](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/events/lunchbytes-2022-02-17.html).


* **Software engineering in High Energy / Particle Physics, 17th March 2022 12:00-13:00**
Talks include:
*  Migrating 4 million lines of C++ code to multi threading
* A new era of computing at the Large Hadron Collider

More details about the event are available [on our website](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/events/lunchbytes-2022-03-17.html).


**Previously scheduled event cancelled, watch this space**
* **Parallelisation: an easy trick to speed up your code?**
Parallelisation - running multiple pieces of work at the same time - can be a great way to speed up research code, but requires an appreciation of the costs introduced by distributing work concurrently over computational assets. This session will be made up of short talks introducing both fundamental concepts needed for successful use of parallelisation, and state of the art technologies available for researchers.

More details about the event are available [on our website](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/events/lunchbytes-2021-12-02.html).


#### LunchBytes needs YOU!
LunchBytes are organised by and for the research software community at The University of Sheffield. If you'd like to curate a session on a topic or present something, get in touch by emailing [lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk) - Or suggest topics [on the jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1-51cRf0pwZl8O10CnLeJGAqKcnbww-QGaYjszFK-H38/)


### News

* [Software Sustainability Institute Fellows 2022 Announced](https://www.software.ac.uk/news/announcing-2022-software-sustainability-institute-fellows) - Among this year's cohort is Sheffield RSE Team member, Dr David Wilby. During his fellowship, David will be developing guidance and training resources around best practices for sustainable research software development in MATLAB, watch this space!

* [Enabling Access to UK Environmental Data](https://research-it.manchester.ac.uk/news/2022/02/01/enabling-access-uk-environmental-data/) - University of Manchester Research IT is to a play a major role in a £7 million project, led by The University of Manchester, to provide easy access to an extensive range of the UK’s environmental data.

* [Call for computationally-intensive papers for review at the first HPC ReproHack](https://www.reprohack.org/event/14/)
[ReproHacks](https://www.reprohack.org/) are one-day hackathons providing a sandbox environment for practicing reproducibility.
  * Authors submit their papers, and publicly available code and data for review prior to the event. On the day, participants attempt to reproduce submitted papers and feed back their experiences to the authors.

  * The format of these events so far has precluded the examination of computationally intensive research. However, with support from the EPSRC, we are excited to partner up with the University of Warwick, UK, who have allocated a large portion of the Sulis tier 2 service (both CPU and GPU resource) to run a *pilot HPC ReproHack event focusing on computationally intensive research* for students of three of their Centers for Doctoral Training in late March 2021!

  * We invite authors who would like feedback on the reproducibility of computationally intensive research to submit details of their paper, code and data for reproduction and review. You can submit your paper on the ReproHack Hub. To ensure your paper is associated with this event, please make sure to select the event on the form during submission. If you would like to make your work available for future HPC ReproHacks, we recommend including an HPC tag. Please see our [Author Guidelines](https://www.reprohack.org/author_guidelines) for more information.

* [French government has awarded Open Science prizes for research software](https://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/fr/remise-des-prix-science-ouverte-du-logiciel-libre-de-la-recherche-83576) (en Français) - Top prizes were awarded to: [Coq (Scientific and Technical Category)](https://coq.inria.fr/), [Scikit-learn (Community)](https://scikit-learn.org/), [Faust](https://faust.grame.fr/), and [Gammapy (Jury Prize)](https://gammapy.org/).


### Featured Software

[**semantic-release**](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) automates the whole package release workflow including: determining the next version number, generating the release notes, and publishing the package.

This removes the immediate connection between human emotions and version numbers, strictly following the Semantic Versioning specification and communicating the impact of changes to consumers.


### Events

* [UK National GPU Hackathon 2022, 28th February and 7-9th March](https://www.gpuhackathons.org/event/uk-national-gpu-hackathon-2022) - Team up with experienced GPU mentors to learn and apply accelerated and parallel computing to your project. **Application deadline has passed.**  

* [N8CIR Digital Research Infrastructure Retreat 28th March - 1st April](https://n8cir.org.uk/news/dri-retreat/) - N8 CIR is hosting a five-day retreat to support the development of soft skills amongst the research computing support community.

* [SSI Collaborations Workshop 2022, 4-7th April](https://software.ac.uk/cw22) - The Software Sustainability Institute’s Collaborations Workshop series brings together researchers, developers, innovators, managers, funders, publishers, policy makers, leaders and educators to explore best practices and the future of research software.

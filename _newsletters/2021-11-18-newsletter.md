### LunchBytes

We have our December edition of LunchBytes coming up very soon, which will be discussing parallelisation!

- **LunchBytes: Parallelisation: an easy trick to speed up your code? 13th January 2022 12:00-13:00**
  Parallelisation - running multiple pieces of work at the same time - can be a great way to speed up research code, but requires an appreciation of the costs introduced by distributing work concurrently over computational assets. This session will be made up of short talks introducing both fundamental concepts needed for successful use of parallelisation, and state of the art technologies available for researchers.

  More details about the event are available [on our website](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/events/lunchbytes-2021-12-02.html).


### News

- **RSdropinUK:** An exciting new service of free Research software technical drop-in sessions for researchers and Research Software Engineers based at organisations in the UK has been launched by members of the RSE community! Each fornightly drop-in session will also include an informal tutorial/walkthrough of a research software engineering tool, aimed at absolute beginners. Check out [their website](https://rsdropin.github.io/RSdropinUK/) for details of the types of problems they can help with and information on how to join the sessions. And don't forget, your friendly local Sheffield RSE team, in collaboration with IT Services, also offer similar [code clinic sessions](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/support/code-clinic/).
- **ReproHack Hub Launch:** Join the ReproHack Core Team, in collaboration with the N8 CIR on the **18th November 2021** in the [inaugural event using their brand sparkling new ReproHack Hub](https://bit.ly/reprohack-hub-launch)! ReproHack events are sandbox environments for practicing research reproducibility where participants attempt to reproduce published research of their choice from a list of proposed papers with publicly available associated code and data. There are two ways to get involved:
    - **As an author:** [Submit your paper for reproduction and review](https://www.reprohack.org/paper/)!
    - **As a participant:** [Join on us on this celebratory day](https://bit.ly/reprohack-hub-launch) and get practical experience in reproducibility with real published materials!
- **GitHub Citation Files:** GitHub have introduced support for [citation files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files). These are simple to use and ensure users of your work can easily cite it correctly!
- **N8CIR High Performance Community Event**: An in-person event on the 13th of December to celebrate the work of the N8 CIR over the last 12 months, including keynotes, presentations and lightning talks. Both Anna Krystalli and Paul Richmond of RSE Sheffield will be presenting lightning talks at this event!
  - [Visit the n8cir.org.uk website](https://n8cir.org.uk/events/high-performance-community/) for more information and to register for the event.

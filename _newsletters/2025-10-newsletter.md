## The University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Community Newsletter October 2025

Welcome to the October 2025 newsletter for the research software community at The University of Sheffield, featuring
news, opportunities, events and training for you.

## News
- Open science boosts citations: A France-wide study reports that open practices correlate with higher citation counts (approx. +8–9% for open access, +13.5% for code sharing, +14.3% for data sharing, +19% for preprints). See Ouvrir la Science and the preprint for details.
- SciX launches: Science Explorer (SciX) has been unveiled as a “one‑stop” platform for discovering research across Earth, environmental and space sciences, evolving from NASA/SAO’s ADS and adding broader coverage and smarter discovery tools.
- University policy on GenAI in research: TUoS Policy Principles for Using GenAI in Research and Innovation have been published under GRIP. These require you to explicitly indicate which sections were produced with GenAI (tool, version, date of use, and whether verified), and set expectations around accuracy checks, data safeguards and more. Please familiarise yourself with the policy (internal access required).
- Network services change on 27 October 2025: IT Services are upgrading core DHCP/DNS. After the change, DNS lookups require fully qualified domain names (FQDNs). For example, use ssh service.shef.ac.uk (or service.ddns.shef.ac.uk for DHCP-hosted machines) instead of ssh service. See “Upgrading our network services” for details.

### Community
#### Digital Research Practice Support Community
The DRPS community is a group for people that support researchers in carrying out research in the digital age. Meetings are held monthly, with discussions around events, training and opportunities related to the field.

You can join the google group here to stay informed.

The next meeting is scheduled for 2pm on Wednesday <YY-MM-DD : TODO>.

#### LunchBytes
LunchBytes are short talks from the research community on research software, data, and infrastructure.

More information on future LunchBytes will be coming out over the coming months, so sign up to the RSE mailing list if you’d like to learn more about research software and associated practices, or get in contact with Norbert if you would like to share what you know at an upcoming session!

### Support
#### Code Clinics
Why not come to a Code Clinic? We’re keen to help you.

Code Clinics are fortnightly supported sessions run by the RSE team and IT Services’ Research IT team. They are open to anyone at TUoS writing code for research to get help with programming problems and general advice on best practices.

At each session, members of the RSE and/or Research IT teams will be available to review code, advise, troubleshoot, and suggest ways to improve your computational workflows.

#### Research IT HPC Drop In
HPC Drop-In sessions are providing assistance with HPC related user issues such as challenges in scaling an application from desktop to supercomputer. We are considering extending the number of our sessions to two or three weekly. These interactive sessions could provide a better interface with our users than our non-interactive ticketing system. These sessions are advertised on the HPC mailing list.

#### Research IT Consultations
Alongside the HPC Drop-In sessions, Research IT are also running one to one consultations to solve in depth user specific problems. These consultations can be booked via our webpage. If you are interested please visit the following link: https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research.

#### Sheffield RSE Team
The Sheffield RSE Team aims to collaborate with you to help improve your research software. They can provide dedicated staff to ensure that you can deliver excellent research software engineering on your research projects.

#### Research IT
Research IT directly supports research, both academic and commercial. We provide large scale HPC systems, advice on everything from statistics to ML to data pipelines and training for both students and staff.

Working with academics, our staff are embedded within research groups on both long and short term engagements.

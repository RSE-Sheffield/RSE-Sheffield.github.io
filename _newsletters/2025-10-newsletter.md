## The University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Community Newsletter October 2025

Welcome to the October 2025 newsletter for the research software community at The University of Sheffield, featuring
news, opportunities, events and training for you.

## News

- [Policy Principles for Using GenAI in Research and Innovation (University of Sheffield)](https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/research-ethics/ethics-integrity/grip/principles-using-genai-research-and-innovation) — Highlights include an explicit requirement to indicate which sections of outputs were produced by GenAI (tool name/version, date used, and whether validated), safeguards on providing data to models, and thorough accuracy checks. Please read and familiarise yourself with the policy.

- [Upgrading our network services (IT Services)](https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/news/upgrading-our-network-services) — On **October 27, 2025**, DNS lookups will require Fully Qualified Domain Names.

### Community

#### Digital Research Practice Support Community
The DRPS community is a group for people that support researchers in carrying out research in the digital age. Meetings are held monthly, with discussions around events, training and opportunities related to the field.

You can join the google group here to stay informed.

The next meeting is scheduled for 2pm on Wednesday <YY-MM-DD : TODO>.

#### LunchBytes
LunchBytes are short talks from the research community on research software, data, and infrastructure.

More information on future LunchBytes will be coming out over the coming months, so sign up to the RSE mailing list if you'd like to learn more about research software and associated practices, or get in contact with Norbert if you would like to share what you know at an upcoming session!

### Support

#### Code Clinics
Why not come to a Code Clinic? We're keen to help you.

Code Clinics are fortnightly supported sessions run by the RSE team and IT Services' Research IT team. They are open to anyone at TUoS writing code for research to get help with programming problems and general advice on best practices.

At each session, members of the RSE and/or Research IT teams will be available to review code, advise, troubleshoot, and suggest ways to improve your computational workflows.

#### Research IT HPC Drop In
HPC Drop-In sessions are providing assistance with HPC related user issues such as challenges in scaling an application from desktop to supercomputer. We are considering extending the number of our sessions to two or three weekly. These interactive sessions could provide a better interface with our users than our non-interactive ticketing system. These sessions are advertised on the HPC mailing list.

#### Research IT Consultations
Alongside the HPC Drop-In sessions, Research IT are also running one to one consultations to solve in depth user specific problems. These consultations can be booked via our webpage. If you are interested please visit the following link: https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research.

#### Sheffield RSE Team
The Sheffield RSE Team aims to collaborate with you to help improve your research software. They can provide dedicated staff to ensure that you can deliver excellent research software engineering on your research projects.

#### Research IT
Research IT directly supports research, both academic and commercial. We provide large scale HPC systems, advice on everything from statistics to ML to data pipelines and training for both students and staff.

Working with academics, our staff are embedded within research groups on both long and short term engagements.

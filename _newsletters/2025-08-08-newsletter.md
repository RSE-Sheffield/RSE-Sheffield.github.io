## The University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Community Newsletter August 2025

Welcome to the August 2025 newsletter for the research software community at The University of Sheffield, featuring news, opportunities, events and training for you.

### News

- [Open Research Prize 2025](https://sheffield.ac.uk/openresearch/home/open-research-prize) - The winners of the University of Sheffield’s 2025 Open Research Prize have now been announced.

- Bessemer HPC will cease service on the 31st October 2025. What do you need to do to prepare?
  - 1) Transfer all relevant/needed data/files/models (in /home & /fastdata) to Stanage. Bessemer /home & /fastdata areas will become inaccessible post 31st October 2025 
  - 2) Confirm that the software you currently use on Bessemer is available on Stanage (do not assume it is) - if it's not then you need to advise us soonest
  - 3) Test your workloads on Stanage
  - 4) Request your Research Storage (/shared) to be mounted on Stanage (if you have not already done so). You will also need to confirm that your /shared areas do not have any sensitive information stored. Please raise a ticket via research-it@sheffield.ac.uk to request this & confirm that you do not have sensitive data stored there
  - Documentation on using Stanage can be found at the [Sheffield HPC Documentation](https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/hpc/index.html#gsc.tab=0)
  - Onboarding sessions that give an overview on the differences between Stanage and Bessemer can be found on [MyDevelopment](https://mydevelopment.csod.com/login/render.aspx?id=defaultclp)

### Community

#### Digital Research Practice Support Community

The DRPS community is a group for people that support researchers in carrying out research in the digital age. Meetings are held monthly, with discussions around events, training and opportunities related to the field. You can join the [google group](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/digital-research-practice-support-community-group/about) to stay informed.
Next meeting: Wednesday 13th August 2025 at 2pm.

#### LunchBytes

[LunchBytes](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/community/lunch-bytes/) are short talks from the research community on research software, data, and infrastructure.

More information on future LunchBytes will be coming out over the coming months, so sign up to the [RSE mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/RSE-group) if you'd like to learn more about research software and associated practices, or get in contact with [Farhad](mailto:farhad.allian@sheffield.ac.uk) if you would like to share what you know at an upcoming session!

### Support

#### Code Clinics

Why not come to a [Code Clinic](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/opportunities/code-clinic/)? We're keen to help you.

Code Clinics are fortnightly supported sessions run by the RSE team and IT Services’ [Research
IT](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) team. They are open to anyone at TUoS writing code for research to
get help with programming problems and general advice on best practices.

At each session, members of the RSE and/or Research IT teams will be available to review code, advise, troubleshoot, and
suggest ways to improve your computational workflows.

#### Research IT HPC Drop In

HPC Drop-In sessions are providing assistance with HPC related user issues such as challenges in scaling an application
from desktop to supercomputer. We are considering extending the number of our sessions to two or three weekly. These
interactive sessions could provide a better interface with our users than our non-interactive ticketing system. These
sessions are advertised on the [HPC mailing list](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/hpc).

#### Research IT Consultations

Alongside the HPC Drop-In sessions, Research IT are also running one to one consultations to solve in depth user
specific problems. These consultations can be booked via our webpage. If you are interested please visit the following
link: <https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research>.

## Sheffield RSE Team

The Sheffield RSE Team aims to [collaborate](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/) with you to help improve your
research software. They can [provide dedicated staff](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/provision/) to ensure that
you can deliver excellent research software engineering on your research projects.

## Research IT

[Research IT](https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) directly supports research, both academic and
commercial.  We provide large scale HPC systems, advice on everything from statistics to ML to data pipelines and
training for both students and staff.

Working with academics, our staff are embedded within research groups on both long and short term engagements.

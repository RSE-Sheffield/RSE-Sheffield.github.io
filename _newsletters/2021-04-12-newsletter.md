## University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Team Newsletter April 2021

This is the 10th monthly newsletter from
the [Research Software Engineering Team][rses] at The University of Sheffield.
We aim to share our experiences and information of other communities for those using software for research.
This newsletter collects interesting events and opportunities over the coming month.
It also signposts to other resources that we find beneficial or interesting.
You may find the content interesting if you are someone in research using software,
are a person paid to develop software (like a Research Software Engineer (RSE)).
or are somewhere in-between (a *research developer*).

To receive this newsletter as an email each month, please sign up to our [Google Group][rses-mail-list].

*All times are BST (UTC+01)*


### News

**[New software TopoStats accelerates DNA discoveries](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/news/new-software-topostats-accelerates-dna-discoveries)**

A new software package allowing scientists to quantify how small circles of DNA change their structure has been developed by researchers at universities in the UK and Germany. <br />
[Bob Turner](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/contact/bob-turner/) of the UoS RSE team has been involved with this project.


### Future events

**[GPU Technology Conference 2021](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gtc/), 12th - 16th April**

The Spring 2021 edition of NVIDIA's GPU Technology Conference is being held as an online event from the 12th to the 16th of April.

Registration for the event is free, providing access to live and recorded sessions, research posters, interactive panels, demos, podcasts, technical sessions, and more.
DLI training workshops can be purchased for an additional fee.

[Dr Paul Richmond](https://paulrichmond.shef.ac.uk/) of the UoS RSE team is presenting a session "[Simulate the World and Everything in it: Complex Systems Simulations with FGPU2 [E31281] (Registration Required)](https://gtc21.event.nvidia.com/media/Simulate%20the%20World%20and%20Everything%20in%20it%3A%20Complex%20Systems%20Simulations%20with%20FGPU2%20%5BE31281%5D/1_jq4vdfcg) at 9AM on Tuesday April 13th.

**Software Sustainability in Practice, 20th April**

This is an informal event by the [Open Research Team at the University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/library/info-for/researchers/support/), aimed at getting researchers together to hear
talks on and discuss the value of engaging in software sustainability
practices. It's quite short, and worth a listen in if you're interested!
There will be lots of overlap with stuff that has been discussed at
Coding Club, but different perspectives being presented.

The host will be Emma Barnes (Research & High-performance Computing Team
Leader), and the speakers are as follows:
* [Prof Simon Hettrick](https://www.software.ac.uk/about/staff/person/simon-hettrick)
(Software Sustainability Institute Deputy Director)
* [Dr Jon Hill](https://www.york.ac.uk/environment/our-staff/jon-hill/)
(SSI Fellow and Senior Lecturer in Environment and Geography)
* [Emma Rand](https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/our-staff/emma-rand/) (SSI
Fellow and Senior Lecturer, Biology)
* Dr Peter Hill (EPSRC RSE Fellow, York Plasma Institute, OUR VERY OWN)
(reposted from N8 CIR list)

**[GUIs-for-RS: Workshop on Graphical User Interfaces for Research Software](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/GUIs-for-RS/), 27th-29th April**


Research software has been a driving force behind the birth and rapid growth of informatics, but it was the appearance of graphical user interfaces (GUI) in the 1980s that made computers accessible to everyone. A GUI helps to reduce the learning curve for using software, increases the base of potential users and can ultimately increase citations and impact. Moreover, a well-designed GUI can perform validation and increase the robustness and reproducibility of the results, productively decoupling developers from users.

The goal of these workshops is to help developers lose their fear - or reluctance - to invest time creating a GUI for their research software, and help them to give those first steps in the development of graphical user interfaces. The target audience is anyone who develops research software as part of their work, in any role, academic level and department.

This event is organised by the [RSE team at Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/research-software-engineering/).

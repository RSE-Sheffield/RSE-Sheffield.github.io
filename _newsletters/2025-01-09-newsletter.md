#### FAIR<sup>2</sup> for research software

This training curriculum offers a modular programme to support researchers in applying FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles and open research practices to their [research software](https://zenodo.org/records/6623556). The programme is aimed at researchers, including PhDs and postgraduate research students at the University of Sheffield, who create code (whether a few scripts or something more substantial) as part of their research and who want to make their research more open by applying the FAIR principles to their software or simply want to become more confident in the research code they are writing.

To find out what the FAIR principles are and why they are crucial to make your research more open, you can watch the introductory talk by Head of Research Software Engineering, Romain Thomas, [_Better software for Better research: Introduction to the FAIR2 for Research Software training programme_](https://orda.shef.ac.uk/articles/media/Better_software_for_Better_research_Introduction_to_the_FAIR2_for_Research_Software_training_programme/27283239?file=49937889). You can also view the [slides](https://fair2-for-research-software.github.io/Better_software_for_better_research/#/title-slide) for this talk.

The [FAIR<sup>2</sup> for research software training programme](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/training/fair4rs/) has been developed by the RSE, Data Analytics Service and Library teams and launched in October. The full syllabus is now live on [MyDevelopment](https://mydevelopment.csod.com/ui/lms-learning-details/app/curriculum/06573f55-12e4-44f1-be4c-fac5ea9d6851) (requires login). The programme will be continuing over the next few months, with the following courses now scheduled:

### Jobs


Check for advertised RSE and RSE-adjacent roles at the [RSE society's vacancies
board](https://society-rse.org/careers/vacancies/).

### Community

#### Digital Research Practice Support Community

The DRPS community is a group for people that support researchers in carrying out research in the digital age. Meetings
are held monthly, with discussions around events, training and opportunities related to the field. You can join the
[google group](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/digital-research-practice-support-community-group/about) to
stay informed. Next meeting: Wednesday 29th January 2025 at 2pm.

#### LunchBytes

[LunchBytes](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/community/lunch-bytes/) are short talks from the research community on research
software, data, and infrastructure.

Due to capacity within the RSE team, there was very limited LunchBytes content over the past academic year.
This should be changing soon, a new coordinator for LunchBytes has been found (Research IT's Farhad Allian), with a plan to reboot these lunchtime seminars in the spring semester.

More information will be coming out over the coming months, so sign up to the [RSE mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/RSE-group) if you'd like to learn more about research software and associated practices, or get in contact with [Farhad](mailto:farhad.allian@sheffield.ac.uk) if you would like to share what you know at an upcoming session!

### Support

#### Code Clinics

Why not come to a [Code Clinic](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/support/code-clinic/)? We're keen to help you.

Code Clinics are fortnightly supported sessions run by the RSE team and IT Servicesâ€™ [Research
IT](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) team. They are open to anyone at TUoS writing code for research to
get help with programming problems and general advice on best practices.

At each session, members of the RSE and/or Research IT teams will be available to review code, advise, troubleshoot, and
suggest ways to improve your computational workflows.

#### Research IT HPC Drop In

HPC Drop-In sessions are providing assistance with HPC related user issues such as challenges in scaling an application
from desktop to supercomputer. We are considering extending the number of our sessions to two or three weekly. These
interactive sessions could provide a better interface with our users than our non-interactive ticketing system. These
sessions are advertised on the [HPC mailing list](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/hpc).

#### Research IT Consultations

Alongside the HPC Drop-In sessions, Research IT are also running one to one consultations to solve in depth user
specific problems. These consultations can be booked via our webpage. If you are interested please visit the following
link: <https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research>.

## Sheffield RSE Team

The Sheffield RSE Team aims to [collaborate](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/) with you to help improve your
research software. They can [provide dedicated staff](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/provision/) to ensure that
you can deliver excellent research software engineering on your research projects.

## Research IT

[Research IT](https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) directly supports research, both academic and
commercial.  We provide large scale HPC systems, advice on everything from statistics to ML to data pipelines and
training for both students and staff.

Working with academics, our staff are embedded within research groups on both long and short term engagements.

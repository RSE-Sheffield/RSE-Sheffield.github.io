## The University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Community Newsletter July 2024

Welcome to the July 2024 newsletter for the research software community at The University of Sheffield, featuring
news, opportunities, events and training for you.


### We are hiring!

We're recruiting a [Research Software Engineer on a permanent contract!](https://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/DIL227/research-software-engineer-rse) Please help forward to anyone who may be interested! Closes: 4th August 2024.


### News

Thank you to everyone who applied for the [2024 RSE collaboration call for proposals](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/RSEtime_call2024/). This call is now closed. We had 25 applications! We will now review the applications and make decisions on the successful projects by the end of the month.


### Events

#### Upcoming events in Sheffield

<!-- List in chronological order -->

- [Changing Research Culture](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/openresearch/events/changing-research-culture)
  - **2024/07/09 @ 10am-3pm**. In anticipation of REF2029’s heightened emphasis on People, Culture and Environment, ‘research culture’ is increasingly coming into scope as a focus of attention for UK institutions. But critical and reflective work is needed to avoid the term becoming, like ‘excellence’ itself, a floating signifier that obscures the genuine conditions, processes and limitations of academic practice. This one-day workshop will address this task with a particular focus on practices around openness and transparency.  In person, with online attendance available for keynote talks only.

- [Register for OpenFest 2024](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/openresearch/events/openfest-2024-call-proposals)
  - **2024/09/10 - 2024/09/12**. Co-delivered by the University of Sheffield and Sheffield Hallam University, OpenFest is our flagship celebration and exploration of open research, providing an opportunity to explore current issues, share experiences, and consider how open research can be applied in your discipline.

#### Upcoming external events

<!-- List in chronological order -->
- [A conversation about Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Accessibility (EDIA) in the RSE community: reflections on successes and challenges](https://diverse-rse.github.io/events/2024-07-31).
  - **2024/07/31 @ 3pm-4pm**. In our next event in the DiveRSE series, Ella Kaye (Research Software Engineer, University of Warwick) and Malvika Sharan (Senior Researcher – Open Research at the Alan Turing Institute and co-lead of The Turing Way) will converse about their experiences in/with the RSE community, as well as both the challenges and successes they’ve encountered when working to improve EDIA.

- [DRI Retreat 2025](https://n8cir.org.uk/training-and-events/dri-retreat-2025/)
  - **2025/01/13 - 2025/01/17**: This five-day residential retreat will again take place in Manchester and comprises panel discussions and group sessions for technology specialists to develop soft skills and network with peers. This national event is open to software engineers, infrastructure engineers, data managers, academics, and industry professionals at any stage of their careers. We encourage those new to these fields to attend. Paid accommodation is offered to all in-person attendees.

### Training


For more forthcoming RSE training events, keep an eye on our
[Training](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/training/) page and join our [mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/rse-group) to hear about new events.

<!-- #### External Training -->

<!--#### Research IT Training-->

<!--Research IT courses have adopted a hybrid approach. The team will be providing their courses both online and in -->
<!--person for the first time since March 2020. The team provides a place for beginners or advanced users to expand -->
<!--their knowledge of HPC and different programming languages. The courses are part of the Doctoral Development -->
<!--Programme. For more information please visit our training registration web page (via VPN): -->
<!--[crs.shef.ac.uk](https://crs.shef.ac.uk).-->

<!--If a course is "sold out" please join the wait list by signing up - we regularly email people to encourage those -->
<!--that can no longer attend to cancel. Those on the wait list get early notification when the courses are run -->
<!--again.-->

<!-- ### Opportunities -->

### Community

#### Digital Research Practice Support Community

The DRPS community is a group for people that support researchers in carrying out research in the digital age. Meetings
are held monthly, with discussions around events, training and opportunities related to the field.

You can join the google group
[here](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/digital-research-practice-support-community-group/about) to
stay informed.

The next meeting is scheduled for 2pm on Wednesday 17th July 2024.


### Support

#### RSE support via the Centre for Machine Intelligence (CMI-RSE)

Sheffield’s [Centre for Machine Intelligence (CMI)](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/machine-intelligence) is funding 1 FTE
of research engineering time, enabling RSE to provide AI/ML services without cost recovery. The CMI-RSE team primarily
supports members of the University community by enabling, designing, implementing and refining AI streams in research
projects.

If you have a project in mind that would benefit from CMI-RSE involvement, please have a look at the
[FAQ](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/cmi-rse/) and complete the application form to register your interest and
begin the conversation.

#### Code Clinics

Why not come to a [Code
Clinic](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGXS55qjU0D0Zcz-KHOVcNTahcr3YC3H0OpoKBo3lWXWED5A/viewform)? We're keen
to help you.

Code Clinics are fortnightly supported sessions run by the RSE team and IT Services’ [Research
IT](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) team. They are open to anyone at TUoS writing code for research to
get help with programming problems and general advice on best practices.

At each session, members of the RSE and/or Research IT teams will be available to review code, advise, troubleshoot, and
suggest ways to improve your computational workflows.

#### Research IT HPC Drop In

HPC Drop-In sessions are providing assistance with HPC related user issues such as challenges in scaling an application
from desktop to supercomputer. We are considering extending the number of our sessions to two or three weekly. These
interactive sessions could provide a better interface with our users than our non-interactive ticketing system. These
sessions are advertised on the [HPC mailing list](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/hpc).

#### Research IT Consultations

Alongside the HPC Drop-In sessions, Research IT are also running one to one consultations to solve in depth user
specific problems. These consultations can be booked via our webpage. If you are interested please visit the following
link: <https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research>.

## Sheffield RSE Team

The Sheffield RSE Team aims to [collaborate](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/) with you to help improve your
research software. They can [provide dedicated staff](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/provision/) to ensure that
you can deliver excellent research software engineering on your research projects.

## Research IT

[Research IT](https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) directly supports research, both academic and
commercial.  We provide large scale HPC systems, advice on everything from statistics to ML to data pipelines and
training for both students and staff.

Working with academics, our staff are embedded within research groups on both long and short term engagements.

## The University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Community Newsletter October 2022

Welcome to this month's newsletter for the research software community at The University of Sheffield, featuring news, opportunities, events and training for you.

> It's been an action packed month. Three new blog posts on the RSE Team website, two focussed on making quality code easy to achieve and one on valuing the outputs of RSEs and others. We've had the launch of the [MATLAB User survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfackAnztuL1fQ_l66XLdEKSIuCIie6T-XrA7srTsmRiiVq_w/viewform) helping push forward better research practises in this vitally important language for research coders. The RSE Team has a new member, [Edwin Brown](/contact/edwin-brown/), who will boost the teams capacity, particularly around AI and Machine Learning. And news that [Paul Richmond is a winner](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/news/paul-richmond-honoured-contribution-society-research-software-engineers) of an award from the RSE Society recognising his contribution as president of the organisation.
> 
> Looking ahead to November, please come along to the next LunchBytes event on ["Teaching Code"](/events/lunchbytes-2022-11-24).

### News, Web & Blogs

#### Blogs from the RSE Team:

* [pre-commit : Protecting your future self](/blog/pre-commit) Pre-commit is a powerful tool for executing a range of hooks prior to making commits to your Git history. This is useful because it means you can automatically run a range of linting tools on your code across an array of languages to ensure your code is up-to-scratch before you make the commit.
* [Demonstrating Importance and Value in Research Software](/blog/2022-10-13-quality-value-research-software) As research software engineers (RSEs) or researchers who develop software & code, at some point we will need to provide evidence that our software actually has some positive effect on the world. Whether this is for career progression, the REF, just for your own peace of mind...
* [Writing better and more shareable code](/blog/2022-10-20-better-code) If you know how to write code, it’s not actually that hard to make it better! You just need to know how.

#### New LunchBytes recording online

* [LunchBytes: From Eyes to Apps](/events/lunchbytes-2022-10-20) Our speaker this month was Dr Ilse Daly who told us about her journey from vision scientist to start-up founder at her company Blackdog Biomechanics.

#### Web and publications

* [Introducing the FAIR Principles for research software](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01710-x) Research software is a fundamental and vital part of research, yet significant challenges to discoverability, productivity, quality, reproducibility, and sustainability exist. Improving the practice of scholarship is a common goal of the open science, open source, and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) communities and research software is now being understood as a type of digital object to which FAIR should be applied.
* [Champions Program — A mentoring & training program for Scientific Open Source Champions](https://ropensci.org/champions/) Research software should serve everyone in our communities, which means it needs to be sustainable, open, and built by and for all groups. Currently, however, there is a dismaying lack of diversity in open source communities in general...
* [Announcing the 2022 Table Contest](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/rstudio-table-contest-2022/) This contest aims to highlight the many great ways people transform and present data.
* [Best Practices for HPC Software Developers (Webinars)](http://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/) The HPC Best Practices webinars address issues faced by developers of computational science and engineering (CSE) software on high-performance computers  (HPC).

## The University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Community Newsletter November 2022

Welcome to this month's newsletter for the research software community at The University of Sheffield, featuring news, opportunities, events and training for you.

### News, Web & Blogs

#### New LunchBytes recording online

* [LunchBytes Panel: Teaching Code](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/events/lunchbytes-2022-11-24.html) - As code and software become an ever bigger part of research (its likely that around 1/3 of researchers write code), coding and other digital skills become ever more important to researchers. Questions around teaching code were put to an online panel. The panel included [Emma Norling](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/people/academic/emma-norling) (Director of Learning and Teaching in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Sheffield), [Shangshang Gu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%E5%B0%9A%E5%B0%9A-%E9%A1%BE-89935b129) (School of Health and Related Research, University of Sheffield), [Ashley Cadby](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/physics/people/academic/ashley-cadby) who plays a key role in teaching code in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Sheffield and [Norbert Gyenge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/norbert-g-gyenge-7ba718201) (IT Services) with expertise in shorter courses. Thanks to Bob for organising the event!

* [Amsterdam Declaration on Funding Research Software Sustainability](https://zenodo.org/record/7330542#.Y4DP7nbP3tU) - The Research Software Alliance (ReSA) and the Netherlands eScience Center hosted a two-day international workshop in Amsterdam (the Netherlands) on 8-9 November 2023 to set the future agenda for national and international funders to support sustainable research software. As the importance of software in research has become increasingly apparent, so has the urgent need to sustain it.
* [Ten simple rules for funding scientific open source software](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010627) - Scientific research increasingly relies on open source software (OSS). Funding OSS development requires intentional focus on issues of scholarly credit, unique forms of labor, maintenance, governance, and inclusive community-building. Such issues cut across different scientific disciplines that make them of interest to a variety of funders and institutions but may present challenges in understanding generalized needs. Here we present 10 simple rules for investing in scientific OSS and the teams who build and maintain it.
* [Case study: Asynchronous task scheduling for the Music #AI project](https://casestudiesrcg.blogspot.com/2022/11/asynchronous-task-scheduling-for-music.html) - Research Innovation and IT have been working on an exciting project with researchers from the Department of Computer Science. The goal of this project was to improve the existing music AI web application in terms of usability, maintainability, and scalability.

<!-- #### Jobs -->

### LunchBytes

[LunchBytes](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/community/lunch-bytes/) are a monthly series of short talks from the research community on research software, data, and infrastructure.


#### LunchBytes needs YOU!

LunchBytes are organised by and for the research software community at The University of Sheffield. If you'd like to curate a session on a topic or present something, get in touch by emailing [lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk) - Or suggest topics [on the jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1-51cRf0pwZl8O10CnLeJGAqKcnbww-QGaYjszFK-H38/).

### Support

#### Code Clinics

Why not come to a [Code Clinic](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGXS55qjU0D0Zcz-KHOVcNTahcr3YC3H0OpoKBo3lWXWED5A/viewform)? We're keen to hear from you.

Code Clinics are fortnightly supported sessions run by the RSE team and IT Services’ [Research and Innovation IT](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) (ITS R&I) team. They are open to anyone at TUoS writing code for research to get help with programming problems and general advice on best practices.

At each session, members of the RSE and/or ITS R&I teams will be available to review code, advise, troubleshoot, and suggest ways to improve your computational workflows.

#### Research IT HPC Drop In

HPC Drop-In sessions are providing assistance with HPC related user issues such as challenges in scaling an application from desktop to supercomputer. We are considering extending the number of our sessions to two or three weekly. These interactive sessions could provide a better interface with our users than our non-interactive ticketing system. These sessions are advertised on the [HPC mailing list](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/hpc).

#### Research IT Consultations

Alongside the HPC Drop-In sessions, Research IT are also running one to one consultations to solve in depth user specific problems. These consultations can be booked via our webpage. If you are interested please visit the following link: <https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research/support>.

## Sheffield RSE Team

The Sheffield RSE Team aims to [collaborate](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/guide/) with you to help improve your research software.

They can provide dedicated staff to ensure that you can deliver excellent research software engineering on your research projects.

The Sheffield RSE Team provides free [Code Clinics][CCs] (in collaboration with [IT Services][its-res-it]), plus [paid services][rse-service] that allow us to collaborate longer term.

## Research IT

The Research and Innovation Team within IT directly supports research, both academic and commercial.
We provide large scale HPC systems, advice on everything from statistics to ML to data pipelines and training for both students and staff.
Working with academics, our staff are embedded within research groups on both long and short term engagements.

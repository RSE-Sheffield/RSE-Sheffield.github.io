## University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Team Newsletter December 2020

Before you read the rest of the newletter, I'd like to point out
our own [Lunch bytes talks on Dec 9](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/events/lunchbytes-2020-12-09.html).
This month's theme is Accelerated Machine Learning, and we have
short talks from NAG and NVIDIA.

This is the 6th monthly newsletter from
the [Research Software Engineering Team](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/) at The University of Sheffield.
We aim to share our experiences and information of other communities for those using software for research.
This newsletter collects interesting events and opportunities over the coming month.
It also signposts to other resources that we find beneficial or interesting.
You may find the content interesting if you are someone in research using software: such as researchers, research developers, or people paid to develop software like Research Software Engineers (RSEs).

To receive this newsletter as an email each month, please sign up to our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/forum/#!forum/rse-group).

*All dates and times are in GMT (UTC+00)*

### Puzzle Corner

Are you looking for a fun programming based set of puzzles to
while away those long (boreal) winter nights?
You might like to try [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) which is
a series of problems that are designed to be solved with the aid
of a computer (no particular programming language is recommended).

Euler Problem 1―Multiples of 3 and 5―is:

> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
> 
> Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.


### News

* On Nov 6, the RSE Team at Sheffield published their [November Newsletter](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/newsletters/2020-11-06-newsletter.html)!
* In November the Consortium for Python Data API Standards
  announced a call for comments on and contributions to their
  first release of the Array API Standard. This attempts to
  create a uniform API, at least for basic operations, across
  array libraries such as NumPy, TensorFlow, Dask, JAX, and so
  on.

### Web and Blogs

- The [**RSE Stories Podcasts**](http://us-rse.org/rse-stories/)
  continues to be strong, with several excellent audio logs recently taped:
    * [Open Science is Critical](http://us-rse.org/rse-stories/2020/michelle-barker/) says *Michelle Barker*.
    * [Key is your value set](http://us-rse.org/rse-stories/2020/brian-hills/), *Brian Hills*.
    * [Give me Security, Give me Hope](http://us-rse.org/rse-stories/2020/alex-koufos/), *Alex Koufos*.

### Software and Updates

- [GitHub on nbdev](https://github.blog/2020-11-20-nbdev-a-literate-programming-environment-that-democratizes-software-engineering-best-practices/)
  GitHub have a nice blog article about their collaboration with
  fastai in bring `nbdev` to GitHub's web-offering (in preview
  only at the moment). Definitely one to keep an eye on.
- [RStudio v1.4 Preview: Python
  Support](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/10/07/rstudio-v1-4-preview-python-support/):
  The RStudio preview has had a minor update, so might be worth a look if
  you haven't tried it yet. Find out about a number of features that will further improve the Python editing experience in Rstudio release 1.4.
- Tool of the month — [dot from graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/about/)
  <br>![A 4 layer graph with a K<sub>2,2</sub> in the
  middle](/assets/images/dot-example.png){: .float-left}
  My pick for ancient Unix tool of the month
  is the venerable [dot from graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/about/).
  I have recently been using this to draw graph networks from git repos.
  `dot` converts a simple text representation of a graph network
  into a PNG file or other graphic format.
  The shell script to generate the network graphic:

    ```
    dot -Tpng > graph.png <<EOF
    digraph G {
      a -> {b1 b2} -> {c1 c2} -> d
    }
    EOF
    ```

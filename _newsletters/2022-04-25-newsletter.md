## The University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Community Newsletter March 2022

Welcome to the monthly newsletter for the [Research Software Engineering Community](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/) at The University of Sheffield.


### Come to a Code Clinic

Why not come to a [Code Clinic](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGXS55qjU0D0Zcz-KHOVcNTahcr3YC3H0OpoKBo3lWXWED5A/viewform)? We're keen to hear from you.

Code Clinics are fortnightly support sessions run by the RSE team and IT Services’ [Research and Innovation IT](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) (ITS R&I) team. They are open to anyone at TUOS writing code for research to get help with programming problems and general advice on best practice.

At each session, members of the RSE and/or ITS R&I teams will be available to review code, advise, troubleshoot and suggest ways to improve your computational workflows.


### LunchBytes

[LunchBytes](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/community/lunch-bytes/) are a monthly series of short talks from the research community on research software, data and infrastructure.


#### LunchBytes needs YOU!
LunchBytes are organised by and for the research software community at The University of Sheffield. If you'd like to curate a session on a topic or present something, get in touch by emailing [lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk) - Or suggest topics [on the jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1-51cRf0pwZl8O10CnLeJGAqKcnbww-QGaYjszFK-H38/).


### News

* [Jupyter everywhere](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyter-everywhere-f8151c2cc6e8) - Embed Jupyter notebooks in any web page with Jupyterlite.

## Sheffield RSE Team

The Sheffield RSE Team aims to [collaborate](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/guide/) with you to help improve your research software.
They can provide dedicated staff to ensure that you can deliver excellent research software engineering on your research projects.

The Sheffield RSE Team provides free [Code Clinics][CCs] (in collaboration with [IT Services][its-res-it]), plus [paid services][rse-service] that allow us to collaborate longer term.

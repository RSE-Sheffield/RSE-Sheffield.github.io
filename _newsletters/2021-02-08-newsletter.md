## University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Team Newsletter February 2021

This is the 8th monthly newsletter from
the [Research Software Engineering Team][rses] at The University of Sheffield.
We aim to share our experiences and information of other communities for those using software for research.
This newsletter collects interesting events and opportunities over the coming month.
It also signposts to other resources that we find beneficial or interesting.
You may find the content interesting if you are someone in research using software,
such as a researcher, *research developer**,
or a person paid to develop software (like a Research Software Engineer (RSE)).

To receive this newsletter as an email each month, please sign up to our [Google Group][rses-mail-list].

*All times are GMT (UTC+00)*


### News

[An *International Council of RSE Associations* has been founded](https://researchsoftware.org/2021/01/27/introducing-the-international-council-of-RSE-associations.html)
to help the various existing national Research Software Engineering associations work better together and
to help develop new national RSE associations.
The UK [Society of Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org/) is one of the founding member organisations.
There will be other exciting announcements from the Society of RSE in the coming days;
follow [@researchsofteng](https://twitter.com/researchsofteng) to find out more.

On 2021-01-27 the **UK national supercomputer [ARCHER](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/)**
was switched off after seven years of service.
[EPCC][EPCC],
who have provided the ARCHER service over that period,
have been [reflecting on its impact and the resources it provided](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/news/2021/01/27/farewell-to-archer.html).
ARCHER has been superseded by [ARCHER2](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/).

##### Previous LunchBytes

The title and theme of the last LunchBytes event (2021-01-13) was *Beyond Static Data Visualisations*.  [A recording of the event and slides for most talks are now available](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/events/LunchBytes-2021-01-13.html).

At the event
we had talks on plotting data in time using video,
the use of Shiny to develop interactive web interfaces to represent datasets or support data manipulation,
a consideration of the problem data visualisation solves and a look at the alternative
tools in the toolbox,
plus an overview of a interactive data visualisation tool written in C++.

Information on all previous LunchBytes sessions (including links to slides/video where available) can be [found on our site](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/community/lunch-bytes/).

### Web and Blogs

HPCWire featured an [article on the Julia programming language](https://www.hpcwire.com/2021/01/13/julia-update-adoption-keeps-climbing-is-it-a-python-challenger/),
which it argues could now be a serious challenger to Python, R and MATLAB given performance features provided by the language itself plus its expanding array of libraries (with the lack of libraries in its early days having limited adoption then).

**Exciting new things in MATLAB**: [Mike Croucher](https://walkingrandomly.com/) (RSE Sheffield alumnus) took up a new post at Mathworks at the start of 2021 so we've been learning about developments in the world of MATLAB:

### Software and Updates

Support for Python 2 [has been dropped](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/#id1)
in the newest version of Pip (the most common tool for installing (pure) Python packages).
This is another reminder that Python 2 in general [is no longer supported](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/) and
people should migrate to Python 3.x if possible.


### Resources

[Code for Thought](https://codeforthought.buzzsprout.com/1326658) is
a new podcast on *software, engineering, research and anything in between*.
The most recent episode was on the challenges of funding research software engineering.
The podcast is run by [Peter Schmidt](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/research-it-services/people/peter-schmidt),
a Senior Research Software Developer at UCL.

If that floats your boat you may also be interested in:

  * the more established [RSE Stories](http://us-rse.org/rse-stories/posts/) podcast,
    run by the super-prolific [Vanessa Soch](https://vsoch.github.io/).
  * the back catalogue of the (seemingly now defunct) [RCECast](https://www.rce-cast.com/) podcast,
    which is largely focussed on high-performance computing technologies.

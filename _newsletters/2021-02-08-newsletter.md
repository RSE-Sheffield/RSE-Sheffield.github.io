## University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Team Newsletter February 2021

This is the 8th monthly newsletter from
the [Research Software Engineering Team][rses] at The University of Sheffield.
We aim to share our experiences and information of other communities for those using software for research.
This newsletter collects interesting events and opportunities over the coming month.
It also signposts to other resources that we find beneficial or interesting.
You may find the content interesting if you are someone in research using software,
are a person paid to develop software (like a Research Software Engineer (RSE)).
or are somewhere in-between (a *research developer*).

To receive this newsletter as an email each month, please sign up to our [Google Group][rses-mail-list].

*All times are GMT (UTC+00)*

### Web and Blogs


A [post from UKRI chief executive Professor Dame Ottoline Leyser](https://www.ukri.org/news/viewpoint-researchs-lone-genius-image-is-unhelpful/)
on why **research's 'lone genius' image is unhelpful**:
good research is often facilated by teams of people with complementary backgrounds and expertise.
Dame Leyser is collaborting with "Minister for Science Research and Innovation, Amanda Solloway, to
find 101 people, doing 101 different jobs that
make major contributions to research and innovation, but who are not researchers and innovators."

---

HPCWire featured an [article on the Julia programming language](https://www.hpcwire.com/2021/01/13/julia-update-adoption-keeps-climbing-is-it-a-python-challenger/),
which it argues could now be a serious challenger to Python, R and MATLAB given performance features provided by the language itself plus
its expanding array of libraries
(with the lack of libraries in its early days having limited adoption then).

---

A new paper in the EMBO Journal (molecular and cell biology) entitled *Reproducible image handling and analysis* looks at
**common problems with image data and analysis in the biosciences**,
suggests protocols that help avoid these issues and
provides guidance to journal editors on how to faciltate the submission of reproducible methods.
[DOI:10.15252/embj.2020105889](https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2020105889).

---

A blog post on [what someone learned when](https://www.adina-wagner.com/posts/portcode/_portmatlab/)
**porting some code from MATLAB to Python**, including
the importance of version control, packaging and documentation.


---

A Nature article on **Five reasons why researchers should learn to love the command line**:
[DOI:10.1038/d41586-021-00263-0](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-00263-0).

---

A post arguing for [**all software projects to have easily discoverable guides to the software's architecture**](https://matklad.github.io//2021/02/06/ARCHITECTURE.md.html).
(Editor: I'm very much in favour of this; such guides are a massive help when trying to familiarise oneself with someone else's code and
a lack of architectural information might result in an open-source software project stagnating through a lack of contribution).


### Software and Updates

**Exciting new things in MATLAB**: [Mike Croucher](https://walkingrandomly.com/) (RSE Sheffield alumnus) took up a new post at Mathworks at the start of 2021 so we've been learning about developments in the world of MATLAB:

  * All TUOS staff and students can now run MATLAB online (without installing anything on their own machines)
    via [https://matlab.mathworks.com/](https://matlab.mathworks.com/) if they
    have a [Mathworks account](https://mathworks.com/login) tied to their uni email address.
    There's even [mobile access](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab-mobile.html) to MATLAB Online.
  * Data persistence is handled by [MATLAB Drive](https://mathworks.com/products/matlab-drive.html).
    TUOS staff and students get 5GB each (ensure you understand the data governance implications before saving data to it).
  * MATLAB Drive can also be [mounted on your own machine](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlabdrive/ug/install-matlab-drive.html).
  * For those wanting something like MATLAB Online but running on their own hardware there's [MATLAB Online Server](https://uk.mathworks.com/support/requirements/matlab-online-server.html).

---

Support for Python 2 [has been dropped](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/#id1)
in the newest version of Pip (the most common tool for installing (pure) Python packages).
This is another reminder that Python 2 in general [is no longer supported](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/) and
people should migrate to Python 3.x if possible.

### Resources

[Code for Thought](https://codeforthought.buzzsprout.com/1326658) is
a new podcast on *software, engineering, research and anything in between*.
The most recent episode was on the challenges of funding research software engineering.
The podcast is run by [Peter Schmidt](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/research-it-services/people/peter-schmidt),
a Senior Research Software Developer at UCL.

If that floats your boat you may also be interested in:

  * the more established [RSE Stories](http://us-rse.org/rse-stories/posts/) podcast,
    run by the super-prolific [Vanessa Sochat](https://vsoch.github.io/).
  * the back catalogue of the (seemingly now defunct) [RCECast](https://www.rce-cast.com/) podcast,
    which is largely focussed on high-performance computing technologies.


---

Online, self-paced MATLAB training is availble to all at TUOS via the [MATLAB Academy](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com).
There are courses on more specific topics such as image processing and deep learning in addition to the fundamentals of MATLAB.

---

If you think there are other great training resources we should advertise, please get in contact (`rse@sheffield.ac.uk`).

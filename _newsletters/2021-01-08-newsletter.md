## University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Team Newsletter January 2021

This is the 7th monthly newsletter from
the [Research Software Engineering Team](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/) at The University of Sheffield.
We aim to share our experiences and information of other communities for those using software for research.
This newsletter collects interesting events and opportunities over the coming month.
It also signposts to other resources that we find beneficial or interesting.
You may find the content interesting if you are someone in research using software: such as researchers, research developers, or people paid to develop software like Research Software Engineers (RSEs).

To receive this newsletter as an email each month, please sign up to our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/forum/#!forum/rse-group).

*All dates and times are in GMT (UTC+00)*


### News

* Welcome to 2021!

#### Lunch bytes
[Lunch bytes](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/community/lunch-bytes/) is a monthly series of short talks for those in the research community at TUOS who work with/write code, use/manage research data and use/manage research infrastructure. Through these talks we come together as a community to discuss best practices and useful methods/tools.

If you're interested in curating a session or giving a talk, get in touch at: lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk

##### Upcoming Lunch bytes
* [LunchBytes #4: Data Visualisation](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/events/LunchBytes-2021-01-13.html) - 12:00 Wednesday 13th January, online Google meet.
  This month, we have talks on plotting data in time using video,
  the use of Shiny to develop interactive web interfaces to represent 
  datasets or support data manipulation, and a consideration of the 
  problem data visualisation solves and a look at the alternative 
  tools in the toolbox.

##### Previous LunchBytes
Video recordings and slides from previous LunchBytes sessions are available via the [RSE Sheffield website](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/)

### Puzzle Corner

Are you looking for a fun programming based set of puzzles to
while away those long (boreal) winter nights?
You might like to try [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) which is
a series of problems that are designed to be solved with the aid
of a computer (no particular programming language is recommended).

Euler Problem 2 - Even Fibonacci Numbers is:

> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
> 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.


### Opportunities

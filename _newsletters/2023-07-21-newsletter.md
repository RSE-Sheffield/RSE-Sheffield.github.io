### Training

With summer coming up, there aren't currently any training courses scheduled. Look out for new sessions in early September. RSE training courses can be found [here](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/events/) and are normally announced to our mailing list, whereas Research IT courses can be found at [crs.shef.ac.uk](https://crs.shef.ac.uk).

<!--#### Research IT Training-->

<!--Research IT courses have adopted a hybrid approach. The team will be providing their courses both online and in person for the first time since March 2020. The team provides a place for beginners or advanced users to expand their knowledge of HPC and different programming languages. The courses are part of the Doctoral Development Programme. For more information please visit our training registration web page (via VPN): [crs.shef.ac.uk](https://crs.shef.ac.uk).-->

<!--If a course is "sold out" please join the wait list by signing up - we regularly email people to encourage those that can no longer attend to cancel. Those on the wait list get early notification when the courses are run again.-->

### Opportunities

+ [Open Infrastructure Fund](https://investinopen.org/blog/open-infrastructure-fund-pilot-cfp/) is taking applications from projects that support the development of open research infrastructure services, for upto $25,000. -  Closes July 31st 2023
+ [Journal of Systems and Software : Special Issue call for papers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-systems-and-software/about/call-for-papers#gender-equality-diversity-and-inclusion-in-software-engineering): Gender Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion in Software Engineering -  Closes 1st November 2023



#### Jobs

No jobs were submitted this period as typically hiring slows during summer, however you can always check for advertised RSE and RSE-adjacent roles over at the [RSE society's vacancies board](https://society-rse.org/careers/vacancies/).


### Digital Research Practice Support Community

The DRPS community is a group for people that support researchers in carrying out research in the digital age. Meetings are held monthly, with discussions around events, training and opportunities related to the field.

You can join the google group [here](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/digital-research-practice-support-community-group/about) to stay informed.

The next meeting is scheduled for 2pm on Wednesday 9th August.


### LunchBytes

[LunchBytes](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/community/lunch-bytes/) are a monthly series of short talks from the research community on research software, data, and infrastructure.

#### LunchBytes needs YOU!

LunchBytes are organised by and for the research software community at The University of Sheffield. If you'd like to curate a session on a topic or present something, get in touch by emailing [lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk) - Or suggest topics [on the jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1-51cRf0pwZl8O10CnLeJGAqKcnbww-QGaYjszFK-H38/).

### Support

#### Code Clinics

Why not come to a [Code Clinic](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGXS55qjU0D0Zcz-KHOVcNTahcr3YC3H0OpoKBo3lWXWED5A/viewform)? We're keen to help you.

Code Clinics are fortnightly supported sessions run by the RSE team and IT Services’ [Research IT](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) team. They are open to anyone at TUoS writing code for research to get help with programming problems and general advice on best practices.

At each session, members of the RSE and/or Research IT teams will be available to review code, advise, troubleshoot, and suggest ways to improve your computational workflows.

#### Research IT HPC Drop In

HPC Drop-In sessions are providing assistance with HPC related user issues such as challenges in scaling an application from desktop to supercomputer. We are considering extending the number of our sessions to two or three weekly. These interactive sessions could provide a better interface with our users than our non-interactive ticketing system. These sessions are advertised on the [HPC mailing list](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/hpc).

#### Research IT Consultations

Alongside the HPC Drop-In sessions, Research IT are also running one to one consultations to solve in depth user specific problems. These consultations can be booked via our webpage. If you are interested please visit the following link: <https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research>.

## Sheffield RSE Team

The Sheffield RSE Team aims to [collaborate](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/guide/) with you to help improve your research software.

They can provide dedicated staff to ensure that you can deliver excellent research software engineering on your research projects.

The Sheffield RSE Team provides free [Code Clinics][CCs] (in collaboration with [IT Services][its-res-it]), plus [paid services][rse-service] that allow us to collaborate longer term.

## Research IT

[Research IT](https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) directly supports research, both academic and commercial.
We provide large scale HPC systems, advice on everything from statistics to ML to data pipelines and training for both students and staff.
Working with academics, our staff are embedded within research groups on both long and short term engagements.

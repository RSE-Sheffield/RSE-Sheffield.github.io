The Institute’s Fellowship Programme provides funding for individuals who want to improve how research software is done in their domains, fields and/or areas of work. Being a Fellow also helps individuals develop skills and knowledge in their area of software sustainability, empowers them to speak about software sustainability issues and network with like-minded individuals from a wide variety of backgrounds. [See here for more details!](https://software.ac.uk/news/applications-ssi-fellowship-programme-2023-now-open) Deadline 2022-10-03.
* [Get up to 12 days of software engineering support for your HPC/ML/GPU project](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/tier2/). The Research Software Engineering team is offering to support researchers with the use of High Performance Computing (HPC), Machine Learning (ML) and Graphics Processors (GPUs) in their research projects. All researchers at our University can receive up to £5,000 of support time, or roughly 12 days of support, provided by a Research Software Engineer (RSE). This call aims to increase the uptake of the University's Tier 2 HPC resources, which are national facilities available to researchers in all faculties. This is an open call and applications are considered on a first-come-first-served basis. The deadline for submitting your application is 2022-09-16. Applications received after this date will be reviewed in the next round.
* [ARCHER2 Embedded CSE (eCSE) Support Call](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/ecse/calls/). The ARCHER2 eCSE call provides funding for up to 18 person months of an RSE/PDRA to work on codes to run on ARCHER2.

<!-- #### Jobs -->

### LunchBytes

#### LunchBytes needs YOU!

LunchBytes are organised by and for the research software community at The University of Sheffield. If you'd like to curate a session on a topic or present something, get in touch by emailing [lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk) - Or suggest topics [on the jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1-51cRf0pwZl8O10CnLeJGAqKcnbww-QGaYjszFK-H38/).

### Support

#### Code Clinics

Why not come to a [Code Clinic](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGXS55qjU0D0Zcz-KHOVcNTahcr3YC3H0OpoKBo3lWXWED5A/viewform)? We're keen to hear from you.

Code Clinics are fortnightly supported sessions run by the RSE team and IT Services’ [Research and Innovation IT](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) (ITS R&I) team. They are open to anyone at TUoS writing code for research to get help with programming problems and general advice on best practices.

At each session, members of the RSE and/or ITS R&I teams will be available to review code, advise, troubleshoot, and suggest ways to improve your computational workflows.

#### Research IT HPC Drop In

HPC Drop-In sessions are providing assistance with HPC related user issues such as challenges in scaling an application from desktop to supercomputer. We are considering extending the number of our sessions to two or three weekly. These interactive sessions could provide a better interface with our users than our non-interactive ticketing system. These sessions are advertised on the [HPC mailing list](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/hpc).

#### Research IT Consultations

Alongside the HPC Drop-In sessions, Research IT are also running one to one consultations to solve in depth user specific problems. These consultations can be booked via our webpage. If you are interested please visit the following link: <https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research/support>.

## Sheffield RSE Team

The Sheffield RSE Team aims to [collaborate](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/guide/) with you to help improve your research software.

They can provide dedicated staff to ensure that you can deliver excellent research software engineering on your research projects.

The Sheffield RSE Team provides free [Code Clinics][CCs] (in collaboration with [IT Services][its-res-it]), plus [paid services][rse-service] that allow us to collaborate longer term.

## Research IT

The Research and Innovation Team within IT directly supports research, both academic and commercial.
We provide large scale HPC systems, advice on everything from statistics to ML to data pipelines and training for both students and staff.
Working with academics, our staff are embedded within research groups on both long and short term engagements.

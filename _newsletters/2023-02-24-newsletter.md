* [Applications open for the University of Sheffield’s Open Research Prize 2023](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library/research/open-research-prize-2023) - Deadline is 31st May. We want to recognise and celebrate the excellent work University of Sheffield researchers are doing to make their research discoverable and reusable by a wider audience. _Prizes up for grabs!_
* [RSECon22 Q&A Extra Time - Society of Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org/rsecon22-qa-extra-time/) - At RSECon22 last year there were a number of talks where there were additional questions that we didn't have time for during the speaker slots. We're very pleased that some speakers have taken the time to do a more extended Q&A with these additional questions and have written it up on the blog.
* [Apply for the current round of Carpentries Maintainer Onboarding!](https://carpentries.org/blog/2023/02/Apply-for-the-current-round-of-Carpentries-Maintainer-Onboarding/) - Applications due 1st March. - The Carpentries is preparing to onboard the next cohort of Maintainers. Currently we have 109 Maintainers serving across 56 core lessons. To keep the community healthy, we need to plan for offboarding people who want to step down from their current positions and finding new people to step into the role.
* [Official MathWorks MATLAB kernel for Jupyter released](https://blogs.mathworks.com/matlab/2023/01/30/official-mathworks-matlab-kernel-for-jupyter-released/)

* [Avoiding the success trap: Toward policy for open-source software as infrastructure](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/open-source-software-as-infrastructure/) - This report compares open-source software (OSS) to three infrastructure systems—water management systems, capital markets, and networks of roads and bridges—and draws on existing policy vehicles from each to suggest policy that supports the sustainability and security of OSS as a communally beneficial resource.
* [What Is ChatGPT Doing … and Why Does It Work?](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/) - Excellent blog detailing how ChatGPT works in simple, readable terms.
* [Data access and the Online Safety Bill](https://www.theodi.org/article/data-access-and-the-online-safety-bill/) - The Online Safety Bill, which the government says delivers its ‘manifesto commitment to make the UK the safest place in the world to be online while defending free expression’, is back in Parliament after some revision and delay. Having made it through the House of Commons, it is now at Committee Stage in the House of Lords, where peers will examine the Bill line by line.
* [Advancing Software Citation Implementation (Software Citation Workshop 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07500) - Software is foundationally important to scientific and social progress, however, traditional acknowledgment of the use of others' work has not adapted in step with the rapid development and use of software in research.

The teaching of reproducible methods has received somewhat less attention, but is no less important. Some excellent examples are documented in the November 2022 issue of Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education, where a number of instructors reflect on "Teaching reproducibility and responsible workflow" and how to embed reproducible workflows, data management and transparent reporting in courses and programmes.


### Training

#### Research IT Training

Research IT courses will be adopting a hybrid approach from March. The team will be providing their courses both online and in person for the first time since March 2020. The team provides a place for beginners or advanced users to expand their knowledge of HPC and different programming languages. The courses are part of the Doctoral Development Programme. For more information please visit our training registration web page (via VPN): [crs.shef.ac.uk](https://crs.shef.ac.uk).


#### RSE Team: Git & GitHub through GitKraken workshop - from Zero to Hero!

<!-- #### Jobs -->

### LunchBytes

[LunchBytes](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/community/lunch-bytes/) are a monthly series of short talks from the research community on research software, data, and infrastructure.

#### LunchBytes needs YOU!

LunchBytes are organised by and for the research software community at The University of Sheffield. If you'd like to curate a session on a topic or present something, get in touch by emailing [lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk) - Or suggest topics [on the jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1-51cRf0pwZl8O10CnLeJGAqKcnbww-QGaYjszFK-H38/).

### Support

#### Code Clinics

Why not come to a [Code Clinic](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGXS55qjU0D0Zcz-KHOVcNTahcr3YC3H0OpoKBo3lWXWED5A/viewform)? We're keen to hear from you.

Code Clinics are fortnightly supported sessions run by the RSE team and IT Services’ [Research IT](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) team. They are open to anyone at TUoS writing code for research to get help with programming problems and general advice on best practices.

At each session, members of the RSE and/or Research IT teams will be available to review code, advise, troubleshoot, and suggest ways to improve your computational workflows.

#### Research IT HPC Drop In

HPC Drop-In sessions are providing assistance with HPC related user issues such as challenges in scaling an application from desktop to supercomputer. We are considering extending the number of our sessions to two or three weekly. These interactive sessions could provide a better interface with our users than our non-interactive ticketing system. These sessions are advertised on the [HPC mailing list](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/hpc).

#### Research IT Consultations

Alongside the HPC Drop-In sessions, Research IT are also running one to one consultations to solve in depth user specific problems. These consultations can be booked via our webpage. If you are interested please visit the following link: <https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research>.

## Sheffield RSE Team

The Sheffield RSE Team aims to [collaborate](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/guide/) with you to help improve your research software.

They can provide dedicated staff to ensure that you can deliver excellent research software engineering on your research projects.

The Sheffield RSE Team provides free [Code Clinics][CCs] (in collaboration with [IT Services][its-res-it]), plus [paid services][rse-service] that allow us to collaborate longer term.

## Research IT

[Research IT](https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) directly supports research, both academic and commercial.
We provide large scale HPC systems, advice on everything from statistics to ML to data pipelines and training for both students and staff.
Working with academics, our staff are embedded within research groups on both long and short term engagements.

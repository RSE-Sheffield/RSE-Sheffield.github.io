### Training

#### Introduction to Deep Learning with Tensorflow in Python

14 September 2022 - 09:00-17:00

Details: <https://rse.shef.ac.uk/training/workshop/2022-09-14-deep-learning-with-tensorflow-in-python>

Recent advances in deep neural networks coupled with an increasing amount and complexity of scientific data collected in a wide array of domains provide many exciting opportunities for deep learning applications in scientific settings. Furthermore, libraries such as Google’s Tensorflow python library have made building deep learning models more accessible through common tools, freely available to researchers.

In this course, we’ll introduce some basic neural network and deep learning theory and give participants practical experience in some popular deep learning models and techniques.

Content includes:

* Introduction to Regression and Classification using neural networks
* Image classification with Convolutional neural networks
* Speeding up the training process of your own models using existing neural network

### LunchBytes: Workflow Managers

The recording from last month's [LunchBytes session](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/events/lunchbytes-2022-07-21.html) on workflow managers is now available [on the event's webpage](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/events/lunchbytes-2022-07-21.html).

Featuring:
* Will Furnass: The Trouble with Scripts - setting the scene by showing us how, without workflow management, stitching several pieces of software together can present some challenges.
* Magda Dabrowska: [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) - a relatively new workflow manager which allows for writing scalable computational pipelines.
* Ian Sudbery: [Ruffus](http://www.ruffus.org.uk/) - one of the oldest of the modern style workflow management systems. Ruffus pipelines consist of a series of python functions that are linked together using a python feature known as decorators.
* Joe Heffer: [Common Workflow Language](https://www.commonwl.org/) -  an open standard for describing how to run command line tools and connect them to create workflows.


#### LunchBytes needs YOU!
LunchBytes are organised by and for the research software community at The University of Sheffield. If you'd like to curate a session on a topic or present something, get in touch by emailing [lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk) - Or suggest topics [on the jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1-51cRf0pwZl8O10CnLeJGAqKcnbww-QGaYjszFK-H38/).

### Support
#### Code Clinics
Why not come to a [Code Clinic](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGXS55qjU0D0Zcz-KHOVcNTahcr3YC3H0OpoKBo3lWXWED5A/viewform)? We're keen to hear from you.

Code Clinics are fortnightly supported sessions run by the RSE team and IT Services’ [Research and Innovation IT](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) (ITS R&I) team. They are open to anyone at TUoS writing code for research to get help with programming problems and general advice on best practices.

At each session, members of the RSE and/or ITS R&I teams will be available to review code, advise, troubleshoot, and suggest ways to improve your computational workflows.

#### Research IT HPC Drop In
HPC Drop-In sessions are providing assistance with HPC related user issues such as challenges in scaling an application from desktop to supercomputer. We are considering extending the number of our sessions to two or three weekly. These interactive sessions could provide a better interface with our users than our non-interactive ticketing system. These sessions are advertised on the [HPC mailing list](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/hpc).

#### Research IT Consultations
Alongside the HPC Drop-In sessions, Research IT are also running one to one consultations to solve in depth user specific problems. These consultations can be booked via our webpage. If you are interested please visit the following link: <https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research/support>.

## Sheffield RSE Team

The Sheffield RSE Team aims to [collaborate](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/guide/) with you to help improve your research software.

They can provide dedicated staff to ensure that you can deliver excellent research software engineering on your research projects.

The Sheffield RSE Team provides free [Code Clinics][CCs] (in collaboration with [IT Services][its-res-it]), plus [paid services][rse-service] that allow us to collaborate longer term.

## Research IT

The Research and Innovation Team within IT directly supports research, both academic and commercial. 
We provide large scale HPC systems, advice on everything from statistics to ML to data pipelines and training for both students and staff. 
Working with academics, our staff are embedded within research groups on both long and short term engagements.

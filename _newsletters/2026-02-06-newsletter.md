## Events

### RSE lunchtime seminars

Members of Sheffield RSE will be hosting a new small seminar series in the new year, with **catered lunches**!

The first lunchtime seminar "Introduction to Software Performance Optimisation", is aimed at any researchers who'd like to be introduced to why they can benefit from reviewing the performance of their code and how easy it can be.

The first seminar is on **Monday 2026-02-23 from 1-2pm**. *Note: change of date from December newsletter.*

You can sign up on [MyDevelopment](https://mydevelopment.csod.com/ui/lms-learning-details/app/event/13505955-32a6-464c-8d6a-2742ba2e8f4d?isOnePlayer=true) (requires sign in to MUSE).

### Community

#### Digital Research Practice Support Community

The DRPS community is a group for people that support researchers in carrying out research in the digital age. Meetings
are held monthly, with discussions around events, training and opportunities related to the field.

You can join the google group
[here](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/digital-research-practice-support-community-group/about) to
stay informed.

The next meeting is scheduled for 2pm on Wednesday 2026-03-25.


<!-- Not currently active, conflicts with alternatively named RSE Seminar Series
#### LunchBytes

[LunchBytes][lunchbytes] are short talks from the research community on research
software, data, and infrastructure.

More information on future LunchBytes will be coming out over the coming months, so sign up to the [RSE mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/RSE-group) if you'd like to learn more about research software and
associated practices, or get in contact with [Norbert](mailto:n.g.gyenge@sheffield.ac.uk) if you would like to share
what you know at an upcoming session!
-->

### Support

#### Code Clinics

Why not come to a [Code Clinic][CCs]? We're keen to help you.

Code Clinics are fortnightly supported sessions run by the RSE team and IT Services’ [Research
IT][its-res-it] team. They are open to anyone at TUoS writing code for research to get help with programming problems
and general advice on best practices.

At each session, members of the RSE and/or Research IT teams will be available to review code, advise, troubleshoot, and
suggest ways to improve your computational workflows.

#### Research IT HPC Drop In

HPC Drop-In sessions are providing assistance with HPC related user issues such as challenges in scaling an application
from desktop to supercomputer. We are considering extending the number of our sessions to two or three weekly. These
interactive sessions could provide a better interface with our users than our non-interactive ticketing system. These
sessions are advertised on the [HPC mailing list][hpc-mailing].

#### Research IT Consultations

Alongside the HPC Drop-In sessions, Research IT are also running one to one consultations to solve in depth user
specific problems. These consultations can be booked via our webpage. If you are interested please visit the following
link: <https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research>.

## Sheffield RSE Team

The Sheffield RSE Team aims to [collaborate][rse-service] with you to help improve your research software. They can
[provide dedicated staff][rse-provision] to ensure that you can deliver excellent research software engineering on your
research projects.

## Research IT

[Research IT][its-res-it] directly supports research, both academic and commercial.  We provide large scale HPC systems,
advice on everything from statistics to ML to data pipelines and training for both students and staff.

Working with academics, our staff are embedded within research groups on both long and short term engagements.

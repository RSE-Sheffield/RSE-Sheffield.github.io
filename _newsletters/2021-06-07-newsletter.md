## University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Team Newsletter June 2021


This is the 12th monthly newsletter from the [Research Software Engineering Team](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/) at The University of Sheffield.

We aim to share our experiences and information of other communities for those using software for research. This newsletter collects interesting events and opportunities over the coming month. It also signposts to other resources that we find beneficial or interesting. You may find the content interesting if you are someone in research using software, are a person paid to develop software (like a Research Software Engineer (RSE)), or are somewhere in-between (a research developer).

To receive this newsletter as an email each month, please sign up to our [Google Group][rses-mail-list]. **Tell you friends!**

To suggest content for a future newsletter either complete [this short form](https://forms.gle/YyQiNjg79tXaLZHq8) or drop us an [email](mailto:rse@sheffield.ac.uk). We can’t promise that we’ll publish everything that’s proposed but we are keen to feature submissions from the research community at the University of Sheffield.

*All times are BST (UTC+01)*


### News 

#### SeptembRSE

The [Conference of Research Software Engineers](https://septembrse.society-rse.org/) is returning this year with a fully online event.

6 - 30th September 2021

> On Monday 6th September 2021, the RSE Community will reunite for SeptembRSE, the Fifth Conference of Research Software Engineers. The conference is a chance for anyone, whether you consider yourself a Research Software Engineer or not, to meet and discuss the development and recognition of research software.

> This year the entire conference has moved online. The flexibility achievable with online events allows the sessions to be spread out so that they occupy the whole of September. All sessions will be streamed, recorded and published, meaning that you will have a whole month of material to explore throughout September at a time that is best for you!

> Submissions are now being taken for; Talks, Posters, Walkthroughs, Workshops, Panels and Discussions. So if you have an idea and want to get involved with the wider RSE community submit your proposal now!

[Submission Deadline](https://septembrse.society-rse.org/calls/): July 2nd 2021 *(Discussion topic submission closes early on June 18th 2021).

#### AHRC Software Requirements Survey

The SSI, with the help of others in the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) community has put together a survey of digital / software requirements for the AHRC. Complete if it’s relevant to your work, e.g. you are in the AHRC funding remit and please forward it to others who could provide input.

They are working to improve the understanding of the digital practices people undertake or wish they could undertake in the arts, humanities and GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives and libraries) communities so that they can tailor their approach to supporting this community, and make recommendations to others working in the field.

The survey asks about your views on digital-tools/software, your experience of developing digital-tools/software, and your practices and preferences for recruiting help with digital tool/software development.

This survey’s focus is the AHRC Research Community and therefore it has a UK focus; participants should be connected with a UK based institution. They will share the findings with AHRC to help them direct their digital infrastructure funding to better align with the communities’ needs. Note they will not share any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) as defined by GDPR with the AHRC.

They are actively seeking views from people who do not develop digital tools / software. They are seeking input from all roles, including senior decision makers, researchers, curators, librarians and software developers in the AHRC remit. As the survey is filled in from an individual perspective, we ask that you also forward it to members of your teams / network.

The survey is available at: [http://bit.ly/ahrc-digital-requirements-survey](http://bit.ly/ahrc-digital-requirements-survey), and should only take 15 minutes to complete. It closes at the end July 2021 after which there will be a prize draw. You will have a chance to win one of four £50 shopping vouchers (please opt-in during the survey).

### Future Events

**[Lunch bytes: Clinical Research Software](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/events/lunchbytes-2021-06-09.html)**

The clinical research we will focus on here relates gathering data on people (e.g. evaluating interventions) rather than more fundamental laboratory research.

Planned talks:

* *REDCap features, setup and maintenance*
* *Transcriptomic Responses for the Identification of Pathogens*
* *Using REDCap to capture the economic impact on households of seeking care for children sick with, or exposed to, tuberculosis in three sub-Saharan African countries*
* *Using REDCap alongside an existing Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system: Fitting in with existing processes and comparing functionality between systems*

**[Funder panel: Challenges & opportunities of funding research software](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/funder-panel-challenges-opportunities-of-funding-research-software-tickets-157219609083?aff=ebdssbonlinesearch)**

14 June 2021 - 10:00-11:15

Software is used across research cycle - from controlling equipment to collect research data to enabling visualisation of complex simulations. Developing good research software engineering (RSE) practices to create better software can improve the reproducibility, reusability and quality of your research.

The panel discussion which will focus on:

Opportunities available to support research software from funders including the Wellcome Trust (e.g. [Open Research Fund](https://wellcome.org/what-we-do/our-work/open-research#funding-opportunities--b7c8)) and Sage Publishing (e.g . [software tools for social science research](https://group.sagepub.com/blog/sage-concept-grants-applications-open-for-new-research-software-proposals)).

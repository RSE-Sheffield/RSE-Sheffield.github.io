## The University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Community Newsletter March 2022

Welcome to the monthly newsletter for the [Research Software Engineering Community](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/) at The University of Sheffield.

### News from the RSE Team

Some sad news for the team - Anna Krystalli, who has been with us since the start, is going to be leaving in mid-April. Anna's contribution to the university has been huge, particularly through the development and delivery of training which creates a legacy of reproducible, open research, and through sharing and using her deep knowledge of `R`. 

Happier news: We'll have a new team member joining us at the beginning of April, more details to follow. And we plan to recruit another team member in the next few months to partially replace Anna's `R` skills.

### Come to a Code Clinic

Why not come to a [Code Clinic](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGXS55qjU0D0Zcz-KHOVcNTahcr3YC3H0OpoKBo3lWXWED5A/viewform)? We're keen to hear from you. Previous "cases" have included:

* Understanding or compiling someone else's code.
* Moving a small amount of code into a different language (e.g. from matlab to python).
* Speeding code up.
* Changing from an obsolete dependency.
* Putting code onto GitHub.
* Changing IDE (e.g. vscode to pycharm).

I think Code Clinics are good for the types of problems I can't frame as a Google search as they're just a bit to complex, or I don't know the right terms!

### 10 years of RSE

This year is the 10 year anniversary of the coining of the term "Research Software Engineer" and the RSE Society are [collecting people's thoughts and feelings on this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScwtACUXqYHmFGVKITliMvIvNRURjjH64Ry4_Te2V2js8Puog/viewform). Do share!

### LunchBytes

[LunchBytes](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/community/lunch-bytes/) are a monthly series of short talks from the research community on research software, data and infrastructure.

**Software engineering in High Energy / Particle Physics, 17th March 2022 12:00-13:00**
Talks include:
  *  Migrating 4 million lines of C++ code to multi threading
  * A new era of computing at the Large Hadron Collider

More details about the event are available [on our website](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/events/lunchbytes-2022-03-17.html).

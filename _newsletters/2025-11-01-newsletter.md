## The University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Community Newsletter November 2025

Welcome to the November 2025 newsletter for the research software community at The University of Sheffield, featuring
news, opportunities, events and training for you.

---

## News

- The full applications to the [Research Software Maintenance Fund - Round
  1](https://www.software.ac.uk/research-software-maintenance-fund/round-1) have been reviewed and the [Software
  Sustainability Institute](https://software.ac.uk) have written a summary of reviewing the 143 proposals submitted. Its
  worth [reading in
  full](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/research-software-maintenance-fund-full-application-funding-panels-completed),
  but of particular note is this observation...

  > Finally, despite encouraging RTPs to apply as leads, most of the applications recommended for funding were led by
  > academic researchers. In one of the three awards led by an RTP in practice, the application had to be submitted with
  > an academic as the lead (but with no resources requested, and with a clear indication in the application that the real
  > lead was the RTP). This exemplifies the difficulties and inequalities that can be faced by RTPs in leading
  > applications.

## Articles, Blogs, Papers & Podcasts

### Articles & Blogs

<!-- #### RSE Sheffield Blog Updates -->

- [Reproducible Research (GNU Guix Cookbook)](https://guix.gnu.org/cookbook/en/html_node/Reproducible-Research.html)_-
  [Guix](https://guix.gnu.org/) is a solid foundation for reproducible research workflows. This section is targeted at
  scientists; it shows how to add Guix to one’s reproducible research toolbox.
- [Flipping the script on machine learning – data first, models later | Software Sustainability
  Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/flipping-script-machine-learning-data-first-models-later)

### Papers

- [FAIR-SMART expands access to supplementary materials for research
  transparency](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003428) _PLoS Biology_ - Supplementary materials that accompany
  scientific articles enhance transparency, reproducibility and scientific   impact. This study presents FAIR-SMART, a
  tool that enables computational access to these materials, improving   findability, interoperability, and reuse,
  thereby improving FAIR access to supplementary data at scale.
- [Which Is Better For Reducing Outdated and Vulnerable Dependencies: Pinning or
  Floating?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08609) **PRE-PRINT** - Developers consistently use version constraints to
  specify acceptable versions of the dependencies for their project. _Pinning_ dependencies can reduce the
  likelihood of breaking changes, but comes with a cost of manually managing the replacement of outdated and vulnerable
  dependencies. On the other hand, _floating_ can be used to automatically get bug fixes and security fixes, but
  comes with the risk of breaking changes.
- [Software Quality Indicators: extraction, categorisation and recommendations from canonical
  sources](https://osf.io/preprints/biohackrxiv/etp3g_v1) **PRE-PRINT** -  Research software plays a central role in modern
  science, and its quality is increasingly recognized as essential for reproducibility, sustainability, and
  trust. Numerous initiatives have proposed indicators to guide quality assessment, yet these indicators are dispersed
  across domains and vary in scope, terminology, and practical use. This work presents a curated catalogue of software
  quality indicators tailored to the needs of research software. Developed during BioHackathon Europe 2024 and refined
  in collaboration with the ELIXIR Tools Platform and EVERSE project, the catalogue consolidates and structures
  indicators from a range of authoritative sources.

what you know at an upcoming session!

### Support

#### Code Clinics

Why not come to a [Code Clinic][CCs]? We're keen to help you.

Code Clinics are fortnightly supported sessions run by the RSE team and IT Services’ [Research
IT][its-res-it] team. They are open to anyone at TUoS writing code for research to get help with programming problems
and general advice on best practices.

At each session, members of the RSE and/or Research IT teams will be available to review code, advise, troubleshoot, and
suggest ways to improve your computational workflows.

#### Research IT HPC Drop In

HPC Drop-In sessions are providing assistance with HPC related user issues such as challenges in scaling an application
from desktop to supercomputer. We are considering extending the number of our sessions to two or three weekly. These
interactive sessions could provide a better interface with our users than our non-interactive ticketing system. These
sessions are advertised on the [HPC mailing list][hpc-mailing].

#### Research IT Consultations

Alongside the HPC Drop-In sessions, Research IT are also running one to one consultations to solve in depth user
specific problems. These consultations can be booked via our webpage. If you are interested please visit the following

## University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Team Newsletter March 2021

This is the 9th monthly newsletter from
the [Research Software Engineering Team][rses] at The University of Sheffield.
We aim to share our experiences and information of other communities for those using software for research.
This newsletter collects interesting events and opportunities over the coming month.
It also signposts to other resources that we find beneficial or interesting.
You may find the content interesting if you are someone in research using software,
are a person paid to develop software (like a Research Software Engineer (RSE)).
or are somewhere in-between (a *research developer*).

To receive this newsletter as an email each month, please sign up to our [Google Group][rses-mail-list].

*All times are GMT (UTC+00)*

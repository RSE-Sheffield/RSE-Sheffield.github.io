## The University of Sheffield Joint newsletter from RSE and Research IT for June / July 2022
### Support
#### Code Clinics
Why not come to a [Code Clinic](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGXS55qjU0D0Zcz-KHOVcNTahcr3YC3H0OpoKBo3lWXWED5A/viewform)? We're keen to hear from you.

Code Clinics are fortnightly supported sessions run by the RSE team and IT Services’ [Research and Innovation IT](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) (ITS R&I) team. They are open to anyone at TUoS writing code for research to get help with programming problems and general advice on best practices.

At each session, members of the RSE and/or ITS R&I teams will be available to review code, advise, troubleshoot, and suggest ways to improve your computational workflows.

#### Research IT HPC Drop In
HPC Drop-In sessions are providing assistance with HPC related user issues such as challenges in scaling an application from desktop to supercomputer. We are considering extending the number of our sessions to two or three weekly. These interactive sessions could provide a better interface with our users than our non-interactive ticketing system. These sessions are advertised on the [HPC mailing list](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/hpc).

#### Research IT Consultations
Alongside the HPC Drop-In sessions, we are also running one to one consultations to solve in depth user specific problems. These consultations can be booked via our webpage. If you are interested please visit the following link: [https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research/support](https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research/support).

### LunchBytes: Workflow Managers

The next [LunchBytes session](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/events/lunchbytes-2022-07-21.html) is from 13:30 on the 21st July.

Scientific workflows (for example in bioinformatics) often require several different scripts or pieces of software to be run and their outputs fed into each other. Ideally, we’d like to be able to understand the provenance of the output, without having to re-run the entire workflow every time a minor change is made to code or data. This is often difficult to achieve with bash or Python scripts (for example), but workflow managers can help.

#### LunchBytes needs YOU!
LunchBytes are organised by and for the research software community at The University of Sheffield. If you'd like to curate a session on a topic or present something, get in touch by emailing [lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk) - Or suggest topics [on the jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1-51cRf0pwZl8O10CnLeJGAqKcnbww-QGaYjszFK-H38/).

###  Research IT Forum
Research IT Forum is primarily to engage the research computing community and share research carried out in specific departments. We also use the Forum to signpost new HPC resources. Previous Fora included GPU accelerated and AI/Machine Learning research, image processing and analysing human language. The recordings are available for all attendees. The next Forum is targeted for October.

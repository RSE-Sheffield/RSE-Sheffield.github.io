## The University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Community Newsletter January 2023

Welcome to this month's newsletter for the research software community at The University of Sheffield, featuring news, opportunities, events and training for you.

### News, Web & Blogs

#### Web and Publications

* From the RSE Team blog [Who's to Blame?](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/blog/git-blame/) - Neil writes about using this unfortunately titled feature of `git` to better understand the history of code in a project.
* A new book with Sheffield-based co-authors "[Live Coding: A User's Manual](https://livecodingbook.toplap.org/)" Performative, improvised, on the fly: live coding is about how people interact with the world and each other via code. In the last few decades, live coding has emerged as a dynamic creative practice, gaining attention across cultural and technical fields—from music and the visual arts to computer science.
* [Announcing the 2023 Software Sustainability Institute Fellows](https://software.ac.uk/blog/2022-12-15-announcing-2023-software-sustainability-institute-fellows) - Read this blog post from the Software Sustainability Institute to find out more about the fellowships they have awarded.
* A comprehensive [Online Rust Course](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/) has been made available by the Android team.
* A really valuable perspective on [convincing academics to use git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgxKJjzh-Y4) (video) from Juulia Suvilehto at NormConf. More useful and interesting videos from [NormConf 2022](https://normconf.com/) are available see the [main track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9OlkY87vf8&list=PLYXaKIsOZBsu3h2SSKEovRn7rGy7wkUAV) and [lightning talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6sS3wVYpM8&list=PLYXaKIsOZBstGUTXZXp2azDk8UJhpVVq3).
* [Invest 5% of research funds in ensuring data are reusable](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00505-7) It is irresponsible to support research but not data stewardship, says Barend Mons.
* MathWorks have added a new MATLAB training course to the catalogue of courses available to everyone at University of Sheffield. If you already know the basics of MATLAB programming, the Object-Oriented Programming OnRamp [Object-Oriented Programming Onramp - Self-Paced Online Courses - MATLAB & Simulink](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/object-oriented-programming-onramp/oroop) (mathworks.com) should take you around 2 hours to complete and will lead to a certificate that you can add to online profiles such as LinkedIn.

* [Symposium: Perspectives on teaching reproducibility](https://shefmethods.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3yBUDlfuDoeNuM6) - 20th June 2023, Sheffield, UK - Reproducibility has gained a lot of attention in research and many disciplines have adopted policies recognizing the value of open scholarship. The teaching of reproducible methods has received somewhat less attention, but is no less important. Some excellent examples are documented in the November 2022 issue of Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education, where a number of instructors reflect on "Teaching reproducibility and responsible workflow" and how to embed reproducible workflows, data management and transparent reporting in courses and programmes. 
* [Centre for Open Science 2023 Unconference on Open Scholarship Practices in Education Research](https://www.cos.io/unconference) - 9th to 10th March 2023 - The 2023 Unconference will be a virtual participation event featuring participant-led sessions analyzing the current state of open scholarship practice seeking solutions to identified problems. Participants will assess barriers to adoption of open scholarship practices unique to the education community and brainstorm strategies for promoting greater awareness.


### Training

#### Research IT Training

Research IT is providing a place for beginners or advanced users to expand their knowledge of HPC and different programming languages. The courses are part of the Doctoral Development Programme.

<!-- #### Jobs -->

### LunchBytes

[LunchBytes](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/community/lunch-bytes/) are a monthly series of short talks from the research community on research software, data, and infrastructure.

#### LunchBytes needs YOU!

LunchBytes are organised by and for the research software community at The University of Sheffield. If you'd like to curate a session on a topic or present something, get in touch by emailing [lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk) - Or suggest topics [on the jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1-51cRf0pwZl8O10CnLeJGAqKcnbww-QGaYjszFK-H38/).

### Support

#### Code Clinics

Why not come to a [Code Clinic](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGXS55qjU0D0Zcz-KHOVcNTahcr3YC3H0OpoKBo3lWXWED5A/viewform)? We're keen to hear from you.

Code Clinics are fortnightly supported sessions run by the RSE team and IT Services’ [Research IT](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) team. They are open to anyone at TUoS writing code for research to get help with programming problems and general advice on best practices.

At each session, members of the RSE and/or Research IT teams will be available to review code, advise, troubleshoot, and suggest ways to improve your computational workflows.

#### Research IT HPC Drop In

HPC Drop-In sessions are providing assistance with HPC related user issues such as challenges in scaling an application from desktop to supercomputer. We are considering extending the number of our sessions to two or three weekly. These interactive sessions could provide a better interface with our users than our non-interactive ticketing system. These sessions are advertised on the [HPC mailing list](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/hpc).

#### Research IT Consultations

Alongside the HPC Drop-In sessions, Research IT are also running one to one consultations to solve in depth user specific problems. These consultations can be booked via our webpage. If you are interested please visit the following link: <https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research>.

## Sheffield RSE Team

The Sheffield RSE Team aims to [collaborate](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/guide/) with you to help improve your research software.

They can provide dedicated staff to ensure that you can deliver excellent research software engineering on your research projects.

The Sheffield RSE Team provides free [Code Clinics][CCs] (in collaboration with [IT Services][its-res-it]), plus [paid services][rse-service] that allow us to collaborate longer term.

## Research IT

[Research IT](https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) directly supports research, both academic and commercial.
We provide large scale HPC systems, advice on everything from statistics to ML to data pipelines and training for both students and staff.
Working with academics, our staff are embedded within research groups on both long and short term engagements.

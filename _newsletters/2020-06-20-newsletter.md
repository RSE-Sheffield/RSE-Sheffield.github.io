## University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Team Newsletter July 2020

Welcome to our new newsletter! The Research Software Engineering Team are passionate about community and training, so we recently had a think about how we get the most out of the resources we currently have for this. Our plan is to run a monthly newsletter, kick off a new series of talks / discussions: "LunchBytes" run online and to provide more information on online training resources. We'll also be signposting fantastic work and events from outside our team. If you'd like the newsletter delivered to your inbox for maximum convenience, please sign up to our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/forum/#!forum/rse-group).

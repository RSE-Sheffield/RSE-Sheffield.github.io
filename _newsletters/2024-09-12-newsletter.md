### Training

The [FAIR<sup>2</sup> for Research Software Training Programme](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/training/fair4rs/) has been developed
by the RSE, Data Analytics Service and Library teams and will be launched in October. An introduction to the programme
will be given in a [LunchBytes session 2024-10-22](../events/lunchbytes-2024-10-22.html). Keep an eye on our
[Training](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/training/) page and join our [mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/rse-group) to hear about these courses and other events.

### Funding Opportunities

- [UKRI DRI: digital research infrastructure skills hubs for accelerated compute – UKRI](https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/ukri-dri-digital-research-infrastructure-skills-hubs-for-accelerated-compute/)
  - This funding opportunity through the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI)
    programme will support the development of two national hubs for digital Research Technology Professionals
    (RTP). These hubs will enable skills development, education and training for the digital professionals within
    accelerated and large-scale compute who support science across the entire UKRI remit.
- [UKRI DRI: Championing knowledge exchange for UK computational science –
  UKRI](https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/ukri-dri-championing-knowledge-exchange-for-uk-computational-science/)
  - This funding opportunity through the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI)
    programme will support the development of one Knowledge Exchange and Communication (KEC) NetworkPlus. The
    NetworkPlus will co-ordinate and enhance knowledge exchange of computational research. It will set good practice for
    dissemination of software developments in UK science across the UKRI remit.
- [Collaborative Computational Communities: towards new CCPs –
  UKRI](https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/collaborative-computational-communities-towards-new-ccps/)
  - Apply for funding to create a new collaborative community, leading to a viable plan for a new Collaborative
    Computational Project (CCP) in the future. This funding enables the creation of a published roadmap and follow-on
    technical scoping activities and a final report. Technical and operational support from the Computational Science
    Centre for Research Communities (CoSeC) is available at no additional cost.

#### Jobs

There are two positions within the University of Sheffield currently being advertised.

### Community

#### Digital Research Practice Support Community

The DRPS community is a group for people that support researchers in carrying out research in the digital age. Meetings
are held monthly, with discussions around events, training and opportunities related to the field.

You can join the google group
[here](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/digital-research-practice-support-community-group/about) to
stay informed.

The next meeting is scheduled for 2pm on Wednesday 18th September 2024.

#### LunchBytes

[LunchBytes](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/community/lunch-bytes/) are short talks from the research community on research
software, data, and infrastructure.

##### LunchBytes needs YOU

LunchBytes are organised by and for the research software community at The University of Sheffield. If you'd like to
curate a session on a topic or present something, get in touch by emailing
[lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk) or suggest topics
[on the jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1-51cRf0pwZl8O10CnLeJGAqKcnbww-QGaYjszFK-H38/).

### Support

#### Code Clinics

Why not come to a [Code Clinic](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/support/code-clinic/)? We're keen to help you.

Code Clinics are fortnightly supported sessions run by the RSE team and IT Services’ [Research
IT](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) team. They are open to anyone at TUoS writing code for research to
get help with programming problems and general advice on best practices.

At each session, members of the RSE and/or Research IT teams will be available to review code, advise, troubleshoot, and
suggest ways to improve your computational workflows.

#### Research IT HPC Drop In

HPC Drop-In sessions are providing assistance with HPC related user issues such as challenges in scaling an application
from desktop to supercomputer. We are considering extending the number of our sessions to two or three weekly. These
interactive sessions could provide a better interface with our users than our non-interactive ticketing system. These
sessions are advertised on the [HPC mailing list](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/hpc).

#### Research IT Consultations

Alongside the HPC Drop-In sessions, Research IT are also running one to one consultations to solve in depth user
specific problems. These consultations can be booked via our webpage. If you are interested please visit the following
link: <https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research>.

## Sheffield RSE Team

The Sheffield RSE Team aims to [collaborate](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/) with you to help improve your
research software. They can [provide dedicated staff](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/provision/) to ensure that
you can deliver excellent research software engineering on your research projects.

## Research IT

[Research IT](https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) directly supports research, both academic and
commercial.  We provide large scale HPC systems, advice on everything from statistics to ML to data pipelines and
training for both students and staff.

Working with academics, our staff are embedded within research groups on both long and short term engagements.

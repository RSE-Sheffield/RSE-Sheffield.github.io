<!-- #### External Training -->

<!--#### Research IT Training-->

<!--Research IT courses have adopted a hybrid approach. The team will be providing their courses both online and in -->
<!--person for the first time since March 2020. The team provides a place for beginners or advanced users to expand -->
<!--their knowledge of HPC and different programming languages. The courses are part of the Doctoral Development -->
<!--Programme. For more information please visit our training registration web page (via VPN): -->
<!--[crs.shef.ac.uk](https://crs.shef.ac.uk).-->

<!--If a course is "sold out" please join the wait list by signing up - we regularly email people to encourage those -->
<!--that can no longer attend to cancel. Those on the wait list get early notification when the courses are run -->
<!--again.-->

<!-- ### Opportunities -->

<!-- - [Description](https://www.elsewhere.ac.uk/): -->
<!--   - More Details (optional) -->

#### Jobs

Check for advertised RSE and RSE-adjacent roles at the [RSE society's vacancies
board](https://society-rse.org/careers/vacancies/).

### Community

#### Digital Research Practice Support Community

The DRPS community is a group for people that support researchers in carrying out research in the digital age. Meetings
are held monthly, with discussions around events, training and opportunities related to the field.

You can join the google group
[here](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/digital-research-practice-support-community-group/about) to
stay informed.

The next meeting is scheduled for 2pm on Wednesday 27th March 2024.

#### LunchBytes

[LunchBytes](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/community/lunch-bytes/) are short talks from the research community on research
software, data, and infrastructure.

##### LunchBytes needs YOU

LunchBytes are organised by and for the research software community at The University of Sheffield. If you'd like to
curate a session on a topic or present something, get in touch by emailing
[lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk) or suggest topics
[on the jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1-51cRf0pwZl8O10CnLeJGAqKcnbww-QGaYjszFK-H38/).

### Support

#### RSE support via the Centre for Machine Intelligence (CMI-RSE)

Sheffield’s [Centre for Machine Intelligence (CMI)](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/machine-intelligence) is funding 1 FTE
of research engineering time, enabling RSE to provide AI/ML services without cost recovery. The CMI-RSE team primarily
supports members of the University community by enabling, designing, implementing and refining AI streams in research
projects.

If you have a project in mind that would benefit from CMI-RSE involvement, please have a look at the
[FAQ](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/cmi-rse/) and complete the application form to register your interest and
begin the conversation.

#### Code Clinics

Why not come to a [Code
Clinic](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGXS55qjU0D0Zcz-KHOVcNTahcr3YC3H0OpoKBo3lWXWED5A/viewform)? We're keen
to help you.

Code Clinics are fortnightly supported sessions run by the RSE team and IT Services’ [Research
IT](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) team. They are open to anyone at TUoS writing code for research to
get help with programming problems and general advice on best practices.

At each session, members of the RSE and/or Research IT teams will be available to review code, advise, troubleshoot, and
suggest ways to improve your computational workflows.

#### Research IT HPC Drop In

HPC Drop-In sessions are providing assistance with HPC related user issues such as challenges in scaling an application
from desktop to supercomputer. We are considering extending the number of our sessions to two or three weekly. These
interactive sessions could provide a better interface with our users than our non-interactive ticketing system. These
sessions are advertised on the [HPC mailing list](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/hpc).

#### Research IT Consultations

Alongside the HPC Drop-In sessions, Research IT are also running one to one consultations to solve in depth user
specific problems. These consultations can be booked via our webpage. If you are interested please visit the following
link: <https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research>.

## Sheffield RSE Team

The Sheffield RSE Team aims to [collaborate](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/) with you to help improve your
research software. They can [provide dedicated staff](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/collaboration/provision/) to ensure that
you can deliver excellent research software engineering on your research projects.

## Research IT

[Research IT](https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) directly supports research, both academic and
commercial.  We provide large scale HPC systems, advice on everything from statistics to ML to data pipelines and
training for both students and staff.

Working with academics, our staff are embedded within research groups on both long and short term engagements.

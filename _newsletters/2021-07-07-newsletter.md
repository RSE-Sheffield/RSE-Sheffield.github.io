## University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Team Newsletter July 2021

Firstly, welcome to the >100 new members of the RSE mailing list this month. This is the monthly newsletter from the [Research Software Engineering Team](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/) at The University of Sheffield.

We aim to share our experiences and information of other communities for those using software for research. This newsletter collects interesting events and opportunities over the coming month. It also signposts to other resources that we find beneficial or interesting. You may find the content interesting if you are someone in research using software, are a person paid to develop software (like a Research Software Engineer (RSE)), or are somewhere in-between (a research developer).

To receive this newsletter as an email each month, please sign up to our [Google Group][rses-mail-list]. **Tell your friends!**

To suggest content for a future newsletter either complete [this short form](https://forms.gle/YyQiNjg79tXaLZHq8) or drop us an [email](mailto:rse@sheffield.ac.uk). We can’t promise that we’ll publish everything that’s proposed but we are keen to feature submissions from the research community at the University of Sheffield.

*All times are BST (UTC+01)*


### News 

#### BBSRC Review of Technology Development in the Biosciences

> As part of UKRI-BBSRC’s review of support for technology development for the biosciences, we are launching a community survey in order to begin collating views and to provide an early-stage opportunity for input from across the bioscience/technology development community. 

Submit your contributions to the [survey here](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/SCHGKDZ)

#### SeptembRSE

The [Conference of Research Software Engineers](https://septembrse.society-rse.org/) is returning this year with a fully online event.

6 - 30th September 2021

> On Monday 6th September 2021, the RSE Community will reunite for SeptembRSE, the Fifth Conference of Research Software Engineers. The conference is a chance for anyone, whether you consider yourself a Research Software Engineer or not, to meet and discuss the development and recognition of research software.

> This year the entire conference has moved online. The flexibility achievable with online events allows the sessions to be spread out so that they occupy the whole of September. All sessions will be streamed, recorded and published, meaning that you will have a whole month of material to explore throughout September at a time that is best for you!

> Submissions are now being taken for; Talks, Posters, Walkthroughs, Workshops, Panels and Discussions. So if you have an idea and want to get involved with the wider RSE community submit your proposal now!

[Submission Deadline](https://septembrse.society-rse.org/calls/): 2nd July 2021

#### Research Software Camp “Beyond the spreadsheet”: call for ideas
>Do you use spreadsheets to conduct your research? Do you prefer a specific tool or approach when using spreadsheets? What events would you run to help other researchers using spreadsheets? Are you interested in sharing your experience or stories of research data management and analysis with spreadsheets? We’d like to hear from you! 

> We have a few ideas for running our live sessions and commissioning content for the Camp, but we’re asking our community about what would be useful to hear/read about and learn from around the use of spreadsheets in research, what works, and taking the first steps into other computation techniques. 

[Submit ideas by the end of July](https://www.software.ac.uk/news/research-software-camp-beyond-spreadsheet-call-ideas)

#### FAIR Principles for Research Software
The [Research Data Alliance](https://www.rd-alliance.org/) has developed a set of principles for research software inspired by the FAIR principles for research data (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable).

The community review period for the guiding document is open until the 11th July (here)[https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/fair-research-software-fair4rs-wg/outcomes/fair-principles-research-software-fair4rs]

#### AHRC Software Requirements Survey

The SSI, with the help of others in the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) community has put together a survey of digital / software requirements for the AHRC. Complete if it’s relevant to your work, e.g. you are in the AHRC funding remit and please forward it to others who could provide input.

They are working to improve the understanding of the digital practices people undertake or wish they could undertake in the arts, humanities and GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives and libraries) communities so that they can tailor their approach to supporting this community, and make recommendations to others working in the field.

The survey asks about your views on digital-tools/software, your experience of developing digital-tools/software, and your practices and preferences for recruiting help with digital tool/software development.

This survey’s focus is the AHRC Research Community and therefore it has a UK focus; participants should be connected with a UK based institution. They will share the findings with AHRC to help them direct their digital infrastructure funding to better align with the communities’ needs. Note they will not share any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) as defined by GDPR with the AHRC.

They are actively seeking views from people who do not develop digital tools / software. They are seeking input from all roles, including senior decision makers, researchers, curators, librarians and software developers in the AHRC remit. As the survey is filled in from an individual perspective, we ask that you also forward it to members of your teams / network.

The survey is available at: [http://bit.ly/ahrc-digital-requirements-survey](http://bit.ly/ahrc-digital-requirements-survey), and should only take 15 minutes to complete. It closes at the end July 2021 after which there will be a prize draw. You will have a chance to win one of four £50 shopping vouchers (please opt-in during the survey).

### Future Events
**Research Software Engineers and Academia, UseR! Keynote, Heidi Seibold**
8th July 2021 (livestream, recording available on youtube following)

**Abstract:** Academia is a strange place. On the one hand it is a hotbed of innovations, on the other hand it is a frustratingly lethargic system. The movement of Research Software Engineers (RSEs) shows this really well as nearly all research relies on research software, yet we are still lacking adequate acknowledgment let alone career paths for RSEs. In this talk I want to discuss the status quo and future of software in research, the role of the R community, and also what it has to do with my personal path.

**[FAIR Data Stewardship Training Fellowship](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/high-performance-computing-for-healthcare-tickets-144650454403)**
>ELIXIR-UK has partnered with the Software Sustainability Institute to build a Fellowship Programme to support and fund Data Stewards to train researchers in how to manage and share data in the life sciences.  This programme is funded by the UKRI innovation scholars award and we look to recruit a total cohort of 20 Data Stewards in the Life Sciences through 2 rounds of applications through 2021-2022.

>Each Fellow will receive a £3,000 honorarium, subject to tax, to support activities focused on writing and delivering training material in the arena of data management to a target audience of individuals working in the Life Sciences.  This Fellowship aims to recruit applicants who work with data day-to-day, to build a community of Data Stewards with practical experience of contemporary life science data management in the UK.  

>This is a fantastic opportunity for those passionate about data management and training. We envisage that this programme will contribute to the professionalisation of data stewardship, which has often been underrepresented in the life science community. Join us and become empowered to develop communities, network with others who share your goals and learn new skills that will benefit you and your collaborators.

>Fellows will be given training, develop teaching material in their area of specialism and take our data steward training into their own institutions. We hope that this will expand the reach of data steward training across the UK and to provide a network for people working in this area.

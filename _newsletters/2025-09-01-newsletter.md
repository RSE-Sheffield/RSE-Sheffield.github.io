## The University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Community Newsletter September 2025

Welcome to the September 2025 newsletter for the research software community at The University of Sheffield, featuring
news, opportunities, events and training for you.

### News

- [ConvRSE](https://mdsimpson42.github.io/converse/)
  - Trustee and Vice-President of the Society of Research Software Engineering and SSI Fellow Mike Simpson has setup
    this useful hub for mental health information and support for the research software community.

- [REF2029 broadens inclusion
  criteria](https://2029.ref.ac.uk/recognising-all-those-who-drive-research-excellence-ref-2029-and-research-enabling-staff/)
  - "_as part of a strategic priority of driving the inclusion of a broader range of roles, career stages and people
    involved in research, those outputs don’t need to be authored by academic staff.  They can be led by any author, or
    equivalent, who has made a significant research contribution to the output – whether that’s an academic, technician,
    research manager or **research software engineer**…indeed any role that enables or leads research._"
- [Early access to Isambard-AI and Dawn AIRR
  Supercomputers](https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/isambard-ai-and-dawn-airr-supercomputers-rapid-access-route/)
  - UKRI has announced calls for access to Isambard-AI and Dawn AIRR super computers, via either a "Gateway route" or a
  "Rapid Access route" (industry only). The Gateway route offers up to 10,000 GPU-hours, to be used within 3 months,
  for first-time users of AI supercomputing resources testing of (novel) algorithms, code, and workflows benchmarking of
  algorithms, code, and workflows before applying for larger AI Research Resource (AIRR) opportunities

The DRPS community is a group for people that support researchers in carrying out research in the digital age. Meetings
are held monthly, with discussions around events, training and opportunities related to the field.

You can join the google group
[here](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/digital-research-practice-support-community-group/about) to
stay informed.

The next meeting is scheduled for 2pm on Wednesday 2025-09-17.

#### LunchBytes

[LunchBytes][lunchbytes] are short talks from the research community on research
software, data, and infrastructure.

More information on future LunchBytes will be coming out over the coming months, so sign up to the [RSE mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/RSE-group) if you'd like to learn more about research software and
associated practices, or get in contact with [Farhad](mailto:farhad.allian@sheffield.ac.uk) if you would like to share
what you know at an upcoming session!

##### LunchBytes needs YOU

LunchBytes are organised by and for the research software community at The University of Sheffield. If you'd like to
curate a session on a topic or present something, get in touch by emailing
[lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk) or suggest topics
[on the jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1-51cRf0pwZl8O10CnLeJGAqKcnbww-QGaYjszFK-H38/).

### Support

#### Code Clinics

Why not come to a [Code Clinic][CCs]? We're keen to help you.

Code Clinics are fortnightly supported sessions run by the RSE team and IT Services’ [Research
IT][its-res-it] team. They are open to anyone at TUoS writing code for research to get help with programming problems
and general advice on best practices.

At each session, members of the RSE and/or Research IT teams will be available to review code, advise, troubleshoot, and
suggest ways to improve your computational workflows.

#### Research IT HPC Drop In

HPC Drop-In sessions are providing assistance with HPC related user issues such as challenges in scaling an application
from desktop to supercomputer. We are considering extending the number of our sessions to two or three weekly. These
interactive sessions could provide a better interface with our users than our non-interactive ticketing system. These
sessions are advertised on the [HPC mailing list][hpc-mailing].

#### Research IT Consultations

Alongside the HPC Drop-In sessions, Research IT are also running one to one consultations to solve in depth user
specific problems. These consultations can be booked via our webpage. If you are interested please visit the following
link: <https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research>.

## Sheffield RSE Team

The Sheffield RSE Team aims to [collaborate][rse-service] with you to help improve your research software. They can
[provide dedicated staff][rse-provision] to ensure that you can deliver excellent research software engineering on your
research projects.

## Research IT

[Research IT][its-res-it] directly supports research, both academic and commercial.  We provide large scale HPC systems,
advice on everything from statistics to ML to data pipelines and training for both students and staff.

Working with academics, our staff are embedded within research groups on both long and short term engagements.

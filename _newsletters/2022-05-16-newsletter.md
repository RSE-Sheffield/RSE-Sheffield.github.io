## The University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Community Newsletter May 2022

Welcome to the monthly newsletter for the [Research Software Engineering Community](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/) at The University of Sheffield.

### Come to a Code Clinic

Why not come to a [Code Clinic](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGXS55qjU0D0Zcz-KHOVcNTahcr3YC3H0OpoKBo3lWXWED5A/viewform)? We're keen to hear from you.

Code Clinics are fortnightly supported sessions run by the RSE team and IT Services’ [Research and Innovation IT](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) (ITS R&I) team. They are open to anyone at TUoS writing code for research to get help with programming problems and general advice on best practices.

At each session, members of the RSE and/or ITS R&I teams will be available to review code, advise, troubleshoot, and suggest ways to improve your computational workflows.

### LunchBytes

[LunchBytes](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/community/lunch-bytes/) are a monthly series of short talks from the research community on research software, data, and infrastructure.

In [May's edition of LunchBytes](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/events/lunchbytes-2022-05-19.html) on the 19th of May, we’ll be getting together to show off our favourite tools that help with using git and GitHub. Think: command-line tools, IDE plugins, GitHub/Lab features, etc.

If you have a git tool you’d like to let others know about - get in touch with the host at d.wilby [at] sheffield.ac.uk

#### LunchBytes needs YOU!

LunchBytes are organised by and for the research software community at The University of Sheffield. If you'd like to curate a session on a topic or present something, get in touch by emailing [lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:lunchbytes-organisers-group@sheffield.ac.uk) - Or suggest topics [on the jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1-51cRf0pwZl8O10CnLeJGAqKcnbww-QGaYjszFK-H38/).

### Join the RSE team!

<!-- https://rse.shef.ac.uk/blog/2022-05-12-rrse/ -->

We have a [job advert out for an RSE](https://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/CPR556/research-software-engineer)! Here are six reasons to apply:

1. **Varied projects.** We work on research in areas such as astrophysics, healthcare, molecular biology, civil engineering and many more. Maybe you've been working on one area for years and you're keen to work with researchers in diverse fields?
2. **We don't need an expert in everything right away.** Lots of people have joined our team having developed coding skills working on research, and learned more software engineering once in the team. Our team is made up of people who specialise in sharing software engineering skills with researchers.
3. **Make a difference.** Our team works with public/private sector organisations, and charities to give our output the best chance of making a positive difference outside the university. We also enthuse about and participate in open research wherever possible.
4. **Flexibility.** We're happy to discuss flexible and part time working options. One of our team has recently reduced their hours from 100% to 80%. Working as a pool makes this much more practicable. Furthermore, in contrast to most RA roles this position is open-ended.
5. **Do useful stuff with code.** We are most interested in your ability to do useful things with code and work with other people. We don’t tend to ask questions about the theory of computer science in interviews. The interest is in modern software technology, code you’ve written, how it was used and how it could be improved.
6. **Reward and recognition.** All of the Sheffield RSE team are employed within the academic careers pathway, a new flexible career development structure which recognises a broad range of research outputs including software. The pathway provides a clear route for promotion up to the level of professor.

Please [view the advert to apply](https://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/CPR556/research-software-engineer), and see contact details for enquiries about the job. General enquires about the team are welcome at [rse@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:rse@sheffield.ac.uk).
Applications close on the 9th of June 2022.

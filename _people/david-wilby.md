David has a background as a researcher using methods from physics and engineering to tackle research questions in Animal Sensory Biology. Following a Physics degree at the University of Bath with a placement year at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, he began a PhD in the Bristol Centre for Functional Nanomaterials, taking this to the Schools of Biological Sciences and Physics, completing with a thesis on the optics of the avian retina using a range of numerical simulation techniques. Following this, David undertook postdoctoral research at the University of Bristol and Lund University, tackling a wide variety of projects in animal vision, most recently in developing automated analyses of large microCT scans of the eyes of bumblebees and hoverflies.

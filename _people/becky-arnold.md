Becky is a Research Software Engineer who worked with the University of Sheffield RSE group and the Alan Turing institute developing open-source [guidance](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) on best practice for reproducible data science. She took a leave of absence from her astrophysics research (where she uses simulations to study the evolution of star clusters) to work on this project.  
Becky left the RSE Sheffield team in 2019 to take up a Postdoctoral Research Associate position at the University of Massachusetts.

She is also a [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) fellow and is using the fellowship finds to organise a [series](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/physics/news/programming-skills-sessions) of talks and workshops on a diverse range of topics surrounding best practice.

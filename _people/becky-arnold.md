Becky is a Research Software Engineer who worked with the University of Sheffield RSE group and the Alan Turing institute developing open-source [guidance](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) on best practice for reproducible data science. She took a leave of absence from her astrophysics PhD (where she uses simulations to study the evolution of star clusters) to work on this project.

She is also a [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) fellow and is using the fellowship finds to organise a [series](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/physics/news/programming-skills-sessions) of talks and workshops on a diverse range of topics surrounding best practice.

Will is a Research Software Engineer who is curently working on:

  - Workflows and data management for the [Sheffield Biomedical Research Centre](http://sheffieldbrc.nihr.ac.uk/)
  - Research computing strategy and support for the [Insigneo Institute for in silico Medicine](https://insigneo.org/)
  - Software development and code optimisation for [Out Of Our Minds](http://outofourminds.shef.ac.uk/),
    a Leverhume Trust-funded project to "develop new, accurate ways of describing speakers’ linguistic knowledge, by
    using machine-learning techniques that mimic the way in which humans learn".

Previous projects:

  - A [JupyterHub service for the University's ShARC HPC system](https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/hpc/jupyterhub.html),
    plus training materials that can be delivered using that service
    (the materials relate to [multithreading/multiprocessing using Python](https://github.com/RSE-Sheffield/hi-perf-ipynb).
    Work conducted as part of [OpenDreamKit](https://opendreamkit.org/),
    an EU-funded project to further the computational mathematics ecosystem.

The path to this point has not been particularly direct:
he has a computer science degree,
has worked as a IT systems engineer in the film industry,
has a PhD plus post-doc experience in water engineering
(where he developed semi-physical and data-driven models of water quality in water distribution networks) and
has provided support to the users of the University of Sheffield's high-performance computing clusters.
In addition he has taught or helped run RSE, water engineering and study skills workshops.
His interests include
helping researchers optimise data analysis workflows (primarily using higher-level languages),
providing training in RSE best practices and
systems administration.

He is an accredited [Carpentries instructor](https://carpentries.org/instructors/) and
has facilitated Software and Data Carpentry workshops on topics
including Python, R, version control with Git, the UNIX shell and SQL.

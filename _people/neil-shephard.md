Neil has taken a convoluted path to reach his current role as research software engineer. After completing his
undergraduate (_BSc Zoology and Genetics_) and post-graduate (_MSc in Genetic Epidemiology_) at _The University
of Sheffield_ he spent a number of years as a _Genetics Statistician_ researching the aetiology of complex human
diseases  at _University of Manchester_, and _University of Western Australia_ before returning to _University
of Sheffield_ learning UNIX system administration and [literate
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) along the way. He then shifted careers to medical
statistics and spent eight years working at the [Clinical Trials Research
Unit](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/scharr/research/centres/ctru) at the _University of Sheffield_. Throughout this time
Neil developed and became enthusiastic about reproducible research and developed practical approaches to achieving
reproducible research in [R](https://www.r-project.org) using  [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

In 2018 he left academia for the private sector working for a telematics company using data captured from
mobile phones and "_black boxes_" to quantify driver behaviour. Here he developed an understanding of working
with geo-spatial data and learnt [Python](https://www.python.org) along with various aspects of good software
development practices including working collaboratively using [Git](https://git-scm.com) for version control.

Neil has taken a convoluted path to reach his current role as research software engineer. After completing his
undergraduate (_BSc Zoology and Genetics_) and post-graduate (_MSc in Genetic Epidemiology_) at _The University
of Sheffield_ he spent a number of years as a _Genetics Statistician_ researching the aetiology of complex human
diseases learning UNIX system administration and [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
along the way at. He then shifted careers to medical statistics and spent eight years working at the
[Clinical Trials Research Unit](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/scharr/research/centres/ctru) at the University
of Sheffield. Throughout this time Neil developed and became enthusiastic about reproducible research and
 developed practical approaches to achieveing reproducible research in [R](https://www.r-project.org) using
 RMarkdown.

In 2018 he left academia for the private sector working for a telematics company using data captured from
mobile phones and "_black boxes_" to quantify drivers behaviour. Here he developed an understanding of working
with geo-spatial data and learnt Python along with various aspects of good software development practice and
version control of software using Git.

Matt is a Research Software Engineer in Complex Systems.
He has a background in computer graphics, using physical-modelling to produce animations. He has recently completed his PhD on modelling the human mouth using the finite element method and also has experience with fluid simulation. Aside from physical-modelling, he also has research experience working with virtual and augmented reality.

Matt's work on the team primarily revolves around the development of [FLAMEGPU](http://www.flamegpu.com/) and advocating the use of GPU computing to support research. 
He is currently improving the performance of a model of tuberculosis spread.

Tamora joined the RSE team in November 2023.  She began her career in
web and software development, working for over a decade in a variety
of roles, before returning to academia to complete an MRes in
population ecology and a PhD in conservation demography at the
University of Sheffield.  While studying for her PhD she became
interested in how she could use her background in software development
to help other researchers to improve their research software outputs
by teaching them about commonly used tools and practices such as
version control.

After completing her PhD in 2020, she joined the Centre for
Environmental Modelling and Computation (CEMAC) at the University of
Leeds as a Software Development Scientist, initially supporting the
Global Challenges Research Fund African Science for Weather
Information and Forecasting Techniques (GCRF African SWIFT)
project. While at Leeds she worked on a range of projects including
[automated synoptic plotting for operational forecasting in
Africa](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-21-0156.1), [visualisation of
climate co-benefits](https://t.co/LQUg41cAft), detection of biometeors
using radar data, and the [FASTA](https://fastaweather.com/) mobile
app for near-real time weather forecasting (nowcasting) in Africa.

She has experience in writing research software using R and Python,
and she has developed and led training in version control and
reproducible research practices since 2016.  She has been a
co-organiser of [Sheffield R Users
Group](https://www.meetup.com/sheffieldr-sheffield-r-users-group/)
since 2017.

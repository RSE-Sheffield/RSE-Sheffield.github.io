Michael joined the RSE team in October 2024.
He comes from a background in Computer Science, following an integrated masters degree and PhD in software testing at the University of Sheffield.
After that, he was a research associate on the [CITCoM project](https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/citcom/home) in the software testing group, also at the University of Sheffield.
During this time, he has been an active member of the software engineering research community and an advocate for good research software practice, having served as a dedicated software reviewer for several software engineering conferences.

Michael's main expertise is in black-box testing of traditionally "hard to test" software through the analysis of software logs and time series data.
He is experienced in Python, and has worked with data science libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and Statsmodels.
He also has experience in functional programming, formal methods, code optimisation, and parallelisation.

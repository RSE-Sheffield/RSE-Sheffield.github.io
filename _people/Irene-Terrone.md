Irene is a PhD student visiting from the [QBio group](https://qbio.di.unito.it/) at the [University of Turin](https://www.unito.it/), working with members of the team linked to [FLAMEGPU](https://flamegpu.com/). Her PhD investigates the development of new simulation paradigms by combining, for instance, classical stochastic simulations with agent-based modeling (ABM),  and using epidemic systems as a case study to develop solutions for preventing and managing health  emergencies.  

The collaboration with the [TrustAlert Project] (https://www.trustalert.it/), funded by Fondazione Compagnia di San Paolo, intending to study different scenarios to deal with health emergencies inside a real environment,  has led the study and evaluate of different emergency scenarios inside a real Italian ospital, the Cottolengo Hospital, and the development of a specific tool to support users in creating real agent-based environments called Forge4Flame (F4F). This tool, implemented in R Shiny, allows users to create a full ABM environment and to define all the virus spread management through a user-friendly graphical user interface. Finally, F4F automatically generates all the configuration files to execute the model utilizing the FlameGPU2 framework.

During the collaboration with the RSE team, she will investigate the design and development of an additional abstraction layer built on top of FLAMEGPU’s submodel functionality, to support reusable and composable submodels within a given application domain, such as shared mechanical force, interaction, or transport models that can be combined to construct larger simulations. The aim is to improve model modularity, code reuse, and accessibility for non-technical modellers, while maintaining high performance on GPU
architectures.

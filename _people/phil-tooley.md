Phil is a Research Software Engineer and former theoretical and computational physicist, with
particular interest in mathematical modelling, code optimisation and parallelism. He is an
experienced developer of "traditional" parallel HPC codes using MPI and OpenMP in C, C++ and
Fortran, but also champions the use of the Numpy/Scipy stack for scientific computing with python.
This includes the use of accelerator technologies including [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org) and
[Cython](http://cython.org/) to write custom python code which is speed competitive with
traditional compiled languages, possible in conjunction with parallel frameworks such as
[Dask](https://dask.pydata.org/).  
Phil left the RSE Sheffield team in 2019 to take up a role as a Senior Software Engineer at the Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG).

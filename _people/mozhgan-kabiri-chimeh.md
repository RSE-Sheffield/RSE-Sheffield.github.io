Mozhgan is a Research Associate/Research Software Engineer who specialises in performance acceleration targeting Many-core and Multi-core architectures. She completed her PhD in computer science in 2016 at the University of Glasgow where her area of research was accelerating logic gate circuit simulation targeting heterogeneous architectures.  As part of her PhD project, she optimised and accelerated simulation algorithms and applied them to various parallel architectures (SIMD enabled machines, clusters, and GPUs). She has practical experience with parallel programming using High Performance Computing languages and models including OpenMP and CUDA.

She is currently working on the new version of [FLAMEGPU](http://www.flamegpu.com/) software framework which allows complex systems modelling on GPU architectures.

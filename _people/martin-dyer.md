Martin joined the RSE team in 2024, and is based in the [School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/mps). He completed his PhD in astronomy at the University of Sheffield in 2020, after which he continued working as a postdoc in the [astronomy group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/mps/research/physics/astrophysics) before transitioning to a role as a research software engineer.

Martin's primary focus is the Gravitional-wave Optical Transient Observer ([GOTO](https://goto-observatory.org/)) project, an international network of robotic survey telescopes which monitor the night sky for transient sources. During his PhD Martin developed the control and scheduling system for the GOTO telescopes, which are located on La Palma in the Canary Islands and in New South Wales, Australia. He is also a member of the [ULTRACAM](http://www.vikdhillon.staff.shef.ac.uk/ultracam/index.html)/[HiPERCAM](http://www.vikdhillon.staff.shef.ac.uk/hipercam/) collaboration, which operates several high-speed astronomical cameras located at some of the world's premier observatories.

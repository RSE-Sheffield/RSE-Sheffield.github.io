Romain joined the RSE Team as Head in August 2023. Prior to coming to the University of Sheffield he was a staff Astronomer at the European Southern Observatory (Chile) where he led the development of the [SCUBA software framework](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020SPIE11449E..0CT/abstract), a tool dedicated to control the quality of more than 15 Very Large Telescope (VLT) instruments.

Romain holds a PhD in Astrophysics and Cosmology carried out at the Laboratoire D'Astrophysique de Marseille, France. He then went for a postdoc at the Universidad de Valparaiso, Chile and became a fellow at the European Southern Observatory a couple of years later. During his research time, Romain focused on the study of high redshift galaxies using large galaxy survey conducted mainly at the VLT. Romain has published various modules/software related to his work in astronomy ([SPARTAN](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26C....3400427T/abstract),[dfitspy](https://astrom-tom.github.io/dfitspy/build/html/index.html), [SEDOBS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26C....3000354T/abstract), [Photon](https://astrom-tom.github.io/Photon/build/html/index.html)).

Bob is a research software engineer who started his career in the private sector working on software and databases, with extensive use of markup languages, after completing a degree in Applied Physics at the University of Durham. Following this stint in small business, he did a PhD in Biophysics at the University of Leeds, before working as a postdoc researcher at the University of Sheffield in several departments, mainly Molecular Biology and Biotechnology. His scientific work included the study of cell walls and the way in which bacteria grow and divide, with more recent work on antimicrobial materials for 3D printing (Additive Manufacturing). In the course of this research, he developed Matlab code for processing single molecule localisation microscopy (PALM/STORM) image data, as well as working in Labview and R, and on many smaller coding projects. His software was used by several groups at the University of Sheffield.

A large proportion of Bob's time is currently spent working on databases to support clinical trials with [Insigneo](https://insigneo.org/) and the [Sheffield Biomedical Research Centre](http://sheffieldbrc.nihr.ac.uk/).

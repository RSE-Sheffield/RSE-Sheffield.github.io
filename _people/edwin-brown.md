Edwin joined the RSE team in October 2022. He comes from a  background in geophysics following a BSc and MSc in Geophysical Sciences at the University of Leeds. After university, he worked in the private sector, developing machine learning (ML) workflows to solve geophysical imaging and inversion problems.

Edwin spends 50% of his time working in the Sheffield RSE team and the rest working in the Research Engineering Group (REG) at the Alan Turing Institute. Edwin has been working on a series of projects with the Sheffield Solar group in the School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences on the topic of modelling electricity demand in collaboration with various industry partners.

Edwin has practical experience in the designing, training and evaluation of ML models. He is experienced in Python having worked with data science libraries such as Pytorch, Tensorflow, tranformers and XGBoost. He has a growing interest in MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) and the practical challenges of scaling up ML practices.

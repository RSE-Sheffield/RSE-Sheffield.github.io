## How can we effectively work together on the same code?

**This is an introductory course, teaching the git and GitHub skills required to manage research code over it's
development lifecycle. These skills are essential for collaborative research teams.**

*This event is for University of Sheffield researchers and research students only.

**Prerequisite skills:** Some programming experience.

**Learning Objectives**

* Version controlling your own project through Git & GitHub.
* Basic collaboration through forks on GitHub.
* Advanced team collaboration through branches on GitHub.
* Using the GitKraken GUI for a smooth version control experience.

This course will be run **in-person**.

We are delighted to be able to make free at point of use training available to the research community, to enable better
software and more open, reproducible research. However, **free at point of use training is not free**. The cost of a
course can easily run to thousands of pounds, if preparation costs are taken into account.

**If you sign up for a course, please make sure you either attend or cancel your booking.** Bookings can usually be
managed using [myDevelopment](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/nap/service/redirect/mydev) or, failing that, by emailing
[rse@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:rse@sheffield.ac.uk).

Running courses that are not fully attended wastes our funding (which is provided by taxpayers, charities and students,
amongst others) and reduces our collective capacity to improve research outputs and researcher experiences.

Persistent failure to attend booked courses might result in you being excluded from future training opportunities.

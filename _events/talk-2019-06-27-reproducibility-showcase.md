On 27th June 2019 the university will host its [first Reproducibility Showcase](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/sheffield-reproducibility-showcase-tickets-63044460679).
The aim is to showcase current good practices at Sheffield and identify the challenges that make reproducing our research difficult.

This event will interest everyone who has wondered about the reliability of research they read in journals, thought about the best way to do their own research, or who is interested in innovations which are helping make research more reliable and open.

It includes a keynote from Professor Marcus Munaf√≤, University of Bristol and UK Reproducibility Network lead: "Scientific Ecosystems and Research Reproducibility".
Also, Will Furnass from the RSE team will be giving a short talk on the challenges of curating research computing environments to make workflows (more) reproducible.  The agenda:

- 11:00: "Scientific Ecosystems and Research Reproducibility". Keynote by Professor Marcus Munafo, University of Bristol and UK Reproducibility Network lead
- 12:00 - 12.30: Lightning talks from attendees
- 12.30 - 14:00: Lunch and Reproducibility Showcase

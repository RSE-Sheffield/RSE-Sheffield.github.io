[This introductory event](https://n8cir.org.uk/events/bede-intro-jan-21/) hosted by the [N8 CIR](https://n8cir.org.uk/) offers those who are new to HPC the opportunity to learn more about Bede’s hardware and software, as well as the support that is available to users, regardless of their experience of HPC.

Bede is the N8’s newest high performance computing (HPC) platform. Since its formal launch in December 2020 researchers have been using the system across a range of academic domains to accelerate their research.

This event will feature information regarding the Bede platform, support available for it and case studies highlighting how it is already being used beneficially in research. One of the case studies will be presented by our very own [Dr Paul Richmond](https://paulrichmond.shef.ac.uk/), discussing the upcoming FLAME GPU 2 software and its use on Bede.

**Following the cancellation of the University of Manchester's ReproHack on Thursday 14 March, this new event gives those planning to attend, and a few more, the opportunity to attend a ReproHack, albeit remotely.**


As well as the traditional activities undertaken during a ReproHack there will be three talks:

- **Daniel Nüst** - Research compendia enable code review during peer review
- **Daniel Piqué** - How I discovered a missing data point in a paper with 8000+ citations
- **Sarah Gibson** - Sharing Reproducible Computational Environments with Binder


#### What is A ReproHack?

**A one-day, hands-on Reproducibility Hackathon.**

We are all excited by the progress made by many authors to make their papers reproducible by publishing associated code and data.

We know how challenging it can be so we want to showcase the value of the practice, both for original authors and as a learning experience for those who attempt to reproduce the work.

During a ReproHack, participants attempt to reproduce published research of their choice from a list of proposed papers with publicly available associated code and data.

Participants get to work with other people’s material in a low-pressure environment, record their experiences on a number of key aspects, including reproducibility, transparency and reusability of materials. and feedback to the authors.



### Ways to Participate

#### Submit a paper
In the run-up to the event, you can [submit details of your paper, code and data for reproduction and review here](https://sheffield-university.shinyapps.io/n8cir-reprohacks/).

**Benefits to authors:**

- Feedback on the reproducibility of your work.
- Opportunity to engage others with your research.
Reproduce

#### Join us at the ReproHack and get working with other people’s material.

Get practical experience in reproducibility with real published materials and the opportunity to explore different tools and strategies.
Get an appreciation that reproducibility is non-trivial but that opening up your work for more people to engage with is the best way to help improve it.


#### Reproducing and reviewing as community value

Ultimately, engaging with such materials is the only way to assess how reproducible papers are ‘out of the box’, evaluate how successful current practices are and for what purpose and identify what works and where the most pressing weaknesses in our approaches are.

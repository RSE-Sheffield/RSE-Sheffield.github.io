The HPC training workshop is an intensive two-day workshop sponsored by 
the [N8 CIR][n8-cir] (N8 Centre of Excellence in Computationally Intensive Research) 
that will be run in collaboration with 
the [Women In HPC][whpc] (WHPC) organization and 
the [Software Sustainability Institute][ssi] (SSI).

This course introduces the basics of High-Performance Computing (HPC) and how to access these resources via the command line.
After completing this course, participants will:

  * Understand motivations for using HPC in research
  * Understand how HPC systems are put together to achieve performance and how they differ from desktops/laptops
  * Know how to connect to remote HPC systems and transfer data
  * Be able to use the Bash command line on remote systems
  * Know how to use a scheduler to work on a shared system
  * Be able to use software modules to access different HPC software
  * Be able to work effectively on a remote shared resource

Lunch and refreshments will be provided.

    please get in touch and we will attempt to provide them.

*LunchBytes is a new monthly series of short talks for those in the research community at TUOS who work with/write code, use/manage research data and use/manage research infrastructure. We hope through these talks we will come together as a community to discuss best practices and useful methods/tools.*

At this LunchBytes event we'll be exploring the process of accelerating machine learning on the cloud and using machine learning to accelerate physics simulations.

[Google JamBoard for Q&A](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1KZ1opLyLQ194sv1ZI0RV-0cr7J16XAVAMNYpkBtpX5w/viewer?f=0): note down questions/comments (using JamBoard Sticky Notes) before/during the event. 


## Scalable ML in the Cloud - First Steps on MS Azure 

*Phil Tooley, HPC Analyst, NAG*

For new users the cloud can be a complex and overwhelming environment, even for experienced users of traditional HPC and on-premises computing. In this talk I will look at some of the common issues experienced when deploying machine learning training in the cloud, and how to get going quickly and efficiently. I will share my own experiences of performing distributed ML training on Microsoft Azure, including what worked, what didn't, and what I wish someone had told me before I started!


## NVIDIA SimNet

*Filippo Spiga, EMEA HPC Developer Relations, Nvidia*

Accelerating physics and engineering using Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN)

*LunchBytes is a new monthly series of short talks for those in the research community at TUOS who work with/write code, use/manage research data and use/manage research infrastructure. We hope through these talks we will come together as a community to discuss best practices and useful methods/tools.*

At this LunchBytes event we'll be exploring ways of speeding up machine learning via some short talks.

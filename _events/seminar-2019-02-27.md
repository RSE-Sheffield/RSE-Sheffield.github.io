**Abstract**: conda is a tool for creating isolated environments of software
packages. Over the last few years it has greatly simplified the
challenge of providing the software dependencies required for many
research computing workflows and it allows certain workflows to be
easily reproduced on different hardware and operating systems (e.g. in
the cloud or on HPC systems). In this talk we cover: what problems
conda tries to solve, the basics of using conda, alternative tools
that address similar problems and issues that may arise when using
conda.

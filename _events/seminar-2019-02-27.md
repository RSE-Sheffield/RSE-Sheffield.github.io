##  The AWK Programming Language

Heralded by some[1] as "235 times faster than hadoop",
AWK is a programmable text processing tool that
has been packaged with Unix, since 1979 ish,
and has been in all major Unix standards since.
AWK builds on the grep and sed tools,
borrowing some of their syntax and style in
a tool that is almost as concise but fully programmable.
AWK is good at cutting through text-based datasets at blazing speed.
I'll introduce you to some its ways.

## conda: reproducible research software environments on your machine, HPC and the cloud"

**Abstract**: conda is a tool for creating isolated environments of software
packages. Over the last few years it has greatly simplified the
challenge of providing the software dependencies required for many
research computing workflows and it allows certain workflows to be
easily reproduced on different hardware and operating systems (e.g. in
the cloud or on HPC systems). In this talk we cover: what problems
conda tries to solve, the basics of using conda, alternative tools
that address similar problems and issues that may arise when using
conda.

I've set this up as a bit of an experiment. I've booked a very small room (6 people) adjacent to the View Café in the student union. The idea is that anyone can come and chat about research code and related things. I wanted a space that was "neutral" i.e. not in a specific department or professional services building. But I also wanted people to be able to identify others to chat to - hence the little room. Hopefully this is a scalable way of doing things and if it works, we can do more.

Drinks and snacks can be bought from View Café.

All University of Sheffield people involved with research welcome.

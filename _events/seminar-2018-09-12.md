**Abstract**: The world’s digital data are still doubling in number every year or so, and research is a big culprit. Whether you measure it by volume, velocity or variety, research data is getting Big. All is not lost, though. It is challenging, and it does take a slightly different approach, but dealing with oodles of research data is not as terrifying as it seems. In this talk I aim to give researchers some practical ideas on working with “big” research data, illustrated with examples of how we manage stuff like this at EPCC.

As code and software become an ever bigger part of research (its likely that [around 1/3 of researchers write code](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/sssurvey/)), coding and other digital skills become ever more important to researchers.

In this online panel discussion, we will explore this with a few questions like these:

- How do you teach code e.g. lectures, live-coding, lab classes? What works well for you?
- Is there a difference between "teaching" and "training" in this context?
- When is the best time in a career to start learning to code?
- I'm a new (student / researcher / lecturer / professor). How do I start learning to code?
- Is writing code an essential skill for quantitative researchers? What are the implications for teaching / training?
- What tips do you have to help others teach better?
- Can the way we train people to code help make software engineering more inclusive and diverse?

There may also be time for some audience questions.

The panel includes [Emma Norling](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/people/academic/emma-norling) (Director of Learning and Teaching in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Sheffield), [Shangshang Gu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%E5%B0%9A%E5%B0%9A-%E9%A1%BE-89935b129) (School of Health and Related Research, University of Sheffield), [Ashley Cadby](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/physics/people/academic/ashley-cadby) who plays a key role in teaching code in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Sheffield and [Norbert Gyenge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/norbert-g-gyenge-7ba718201) (IT Services) with expertise in shorter courses.

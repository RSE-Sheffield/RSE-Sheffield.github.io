As code and software become an ever bigger part of research (its likely that [around 1/3 of researchers write code](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/sssurvey/)), coding and other digital skills become ever more important to researchers. In this online panel discussion, we will explore this with a few questions:

- How do you teach code e.g. lectures, live-coding, lab classes? What works well for you?
- Is there a difference between "teaching" and "training" in this context?
- When is the best time in a career to start learning to code?
- I'm a new (student / researcher / lecturer / professor). How do I start learning to code?
- Is writing code an essential skill for quantitative researchers? What are the implications for teaching / training?
- What tips do you have to help others teach better?
- Can the way we train people to code help make software engineering more inclusive and diverse?

There may also be time for some audience questions.

The panel (currently being put together!) will include amongst others people who do short training courses and those involved with undergraduate teaching over long timescales, across a few research areas, maybe some people who are learning as well. If you'd like to be on the panel, please contact [r.d.turner@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:r.d.turner@sheffield.ac.uk).

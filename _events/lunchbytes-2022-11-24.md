As code and software become an ever bigger part of research (its likely that [around 1/3 of researchers write code](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/sssurvey/)), coding and other digital skills become ever more important to researchers. In this online panel discussion, we will explore this with a few questions like these:

- How do you teach code e.g. lectures, live-coding, lab classes? What works well for you?
- Is there a difference between "teaching" and "training" in this context?
- When is the best time in a career to start learning to code?
- I'm a new (student / researcher / lecturer / professor). How do I start learning to code?
- Is writing code an essential skill for quantitative researchers? What are the implications for teaching / training?
- What tips do you have to help others teach better?
- Can the way we train people to code help make software engineering more inclusive and diverse?

There may also be time for some audience questions.

Research software is increasingly becoming a key and fundamental part of research. There is a growing recognition that
research software would benefit from adhering to the FAIR principles which is the main motivation behind the FAIR4RS
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable for Research Software) principles. This is an extension of the FAIR
principles, which acknowledges the applicability of the FAIR approach to research software.

Software packaging has many benefits, such as enabling your research software to be discovered, installed, and utilised
with ease.  The course will explore the fundamental concepts of FAIR4RS, how it applies to packaging, its execution
within Python, and the adoption of best practices in this domain.

Target audience:

 This course is aimed at researchers, including postgraduate research students, who are looking to make their code more
 discoverable, readily usable, and reproducible through the use of packaging.

**Prerequisite skills:** Basic understanding of Python. Experience with version control/Git/GitHub.

*This event is for University of Sheffield researchers and research students only.*


**Learning Objectives**

After completing this course, participants should be able to:

* Create well-structured Python packages with clear documentation and modularised code.
* Incorporate Continuous Integration pipelines to automate testing and ensure package reliability.
* Distribute Python packages through package repositories and manage versioning to facilitate adoption and updates.

This course will be run **in-person**.

We are delighted to be able to make free at point of use training available to the research community, to enable better
software and more open, reproducible research. However, **free at point of use training is not free**. The cost of a
course can easily run to thousands of pounds, if preparation costs are taken into account.

**If you sign up for a course, please make sure you either attend or cancel your booking.** Bookings can usually be
managed using [myDevelopment](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/nap/service/redirect/mydev) or, failing that, by emailing
[rse@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:rse@sheffield.ac.uk).

Running courses that are not fully attended wastes our funding (which is provided by taxpayers, charities and students,
amongst others) and reduces our collective capacity to improve research outputs and researcher experiences.

Persistent failure to attend booked courses might result in you being excluded from future training opportunities.

### Abstract

In this talk, I'll take you through my journey from vision scientist to start-up founder. 

I've had a varied academic career, going from a Physics undergraduate to an Ecology of Vision PhD where I specialised in tracking and understanding the weird and wonderful eyes of the mantis shrimp. Mantis shrimp have 12 distinct colour receptors (we have 3), can see 2 types of polarized light (we see none) and can move their eyes independently in three rotational planes. Building a bespoke mantis shrimp eye tracker was an *"interesting"* task, which put me on the path to becoming a software developer. However, there's a pretty big gulf between being a true software developer and someone who just writes MATLAB code to track shrimp eyes!

As my academic career went on, I realised two things 1) academia wasn't really for me and 2) the computer vision techniques I'd been learning could be used for a lot of useful stuff. So I started tinkering on the side - in the evenings and at weekends and I eventually fell into app development, which in turn led to me to starting my own business; BLACKDOG biomechanics.

Sounds easy right: have an idea, write the app, sell the app... Turns out that's not entirely how it works, as I'll show in this talk.

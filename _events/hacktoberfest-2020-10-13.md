Many of the world's most influential software projects are open source - and it doesn't take a master developer to contribute meaningful code and help them improve. Hacktoberfest is all about encouraging meaningful contributions to the open-source ecosystem
and Hacktoberfest meetups are **for beginners and veterans alike**!

To read more about open source, check out [Bob's blog post](/blog/2020-09-21-open-source/).

[Research Software Engineering (RSE) Sheffield](/),
are organising a **series in of hackathons** during October
as part of [**Hacktoberfest 2020**][hacktoberfest],
a **global initiative to encourage participation in open-source software projects**.

Anyone in Sheffield (not just The University of Sheffield) is welcome to come along to the 3 drop-in hack sessions (13th, 20th, 27th Oct 2020) where you'll be able to chat open source, get guidance from your fellow hackers and socialise with the Sheffield open source community. Members of the RSE team will be on hand to help you find suitable projects to contribute to throughout Hacktoberfest.

**Get free swag/trees!** - By making 4 contributions to open source projects on GitHub during October, you will earn either a free stylish Hacktoberfest t-shirt or the opportunity to plant a tree! See [Hacktoberfest][hacktoberfest] for details.

**Location**

#### Course Description


Recent advances in deep neural networks coupled with an increasing amount and complexity of scientific data collected in a wide array of domains provide many [exciting opportunities for deep learning applications in scientific settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11755). Furthermore, libraries such as Google’s Tensorflow python library have made building deep learning models more accessible through common tools, freely available to researchers.

Furthermore, libraries such as Google’s Tensorflow and the higher-level [Keras](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/guide/keras/) library have made building deep learning models more accessible through common tools freely available to researchers, including R.

**Content includes:**

- Introduction to Regression and Classification using neural networks
- Image classification with Convolutional neural networks
- Speeding up the training process of your own models using existing neural network

#### Course Delivery

There will be a significant practical element to the course and we will be working online in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notebooks.

#### Course Requirements

Familiarity with R programming basics.

[Join us](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/open-research-conversation-reproducibility-in-practice-tickets-123726442119#) for a discussion on the importance of reproducibility and the challenges faced when attempting to reproduce others' research.

### Event Description

Reproducibility, recreating the results others have found in their research, presents many challenges for researchers, with [several studies](theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/27/attempt-to-replicate-major-social-scientific-findings-of-past-decade-fails) suggesting that much published cannot be reproduced. The University of Sheffield has an [active reproducibility network](https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/sheffield-reproducibility/), is a member of the [UK Reproducibility Network](https://www.ukrn.org/) and has created a new post of Research Practice Lead. This event will include presentations and discussions on reproducibility and the practical lessons learnt from running [ReproHacks](https://github.com/reprohack/reprohack-hq). Speakers will include:

- Tom Stafford, Department of Psychology and the Universityâ€™s Research Practice Lead
- Anna Krystalli, Research Software Engineer

This event is part of a series of Open Research Conversations facilitated by The University of Sheffield Library, which include talks from researchers and other experts to share their experiences, promote best practices and discuss the challenges they are facing.

### Talk by Anna Krystalli - _ReproHacks: Practicing reproducibility makes better_

In this talk, I introduce ReproHacks, one day reproducbility hackathons, where participants attempt to reproduce research from associated published code and data. I discuss the importance of providing space to practice reproducibility, some of the lessons learnt from running ReproHack events so far and some thoughts on moving forward.

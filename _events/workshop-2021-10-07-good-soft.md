## How can we write better research software? 

**If you want the software you make for research to produce trustworthy results and to be reusable by others on different computers, this course will help.**

*This event is for University of Sheffield researchers and research students only. Please register with an **@shef.ac.uk** or **@sheffield.ac.uk** email address to ensure your ticket request is accepted.*

**Prerequisite skills:** Some python programming experience.

**Learning Objectives**

* Add documentation directly into python code using "docstrings"
* How and when to make your code open source
* Write tests (using `pytest`) so you can update your code with confidence

This is a pilot course and as such we may encounter problems that we wouldn't normally expect. We will use feedback from this event to improve the course in future! Learning objectives are subject to change.

We plan to run this course online, but will investigate the possibly of hybrid delivery.

Parallelisation - running lots of things at the same time - could be a great way to speed up research code, but requires an appreciation of how computer resources are used to do the work we want them to do. This session will be made up of short talks introducing both fundamental concepts needed for sucessful use of parallelisation, and state of the art technologies available for researchers.

This session will take place on [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/ozm-cops-ktj) and participants can join 15 minutes before the start of the session. 

We also have a [Google Jam Board](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1gxOkpOmEE2xwK7DFo1Lbql8nJ4SvGvafmzl0qEBVfbs) where you can note down any questions or comments before or during the event.

**OpenMP: Data parallelism in 2, 1, 3?**

*Paul Richmond*

OpenMP offers an easy way to add data parallelism to your existing code. In this talk I will provide a crash course in data parallelism and provide examples of just how simple it can be to use OpenMP to parallelise simple cases. For not so simple cases, I will identify the general approaches of what can be done and signpost to more complex approaches.

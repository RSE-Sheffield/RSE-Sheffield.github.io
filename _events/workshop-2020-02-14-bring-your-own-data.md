Is your data a bit messy?
Can't find that all-important file? 
Looking for a better way to structure your data but not sure where to start?

Come along to this *Bring Your Own Data workshop* in [Love Data
Week](https://lovedataweek.org/) and get hands-on support and advice to get
your data in order.

The session will start with some brief introductions to best practice in
managing and analysing your data from experts in the Library and IT Services. They
will then spend most of the time working with you to organise and structure
your data - so make sure you bring some data with you!

#### Course Description

"Deep Learning Demystified: Foundations for Non-Computer Scientists" is an accessible and comprehensive course designed 
to introduce individuals from diverse backgrounds to the fundamental concepts of deep learning. 
Through clear explanations and real-world examples, participants will gain a solid understanding of key components of 
deep learning. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with the knowledge and confidence to engage 
with and apply deep learning techniques in various fields, regardless of their technical background.

**Objectives**

- Utilise the Tensorflow Keras framework to execute standard deep learning workflows.
- Explore diverse data, training parameters, network architectures, and other methodologies to enhance performance and functionality.
- Transition your trained neural networks into deployment to tackle practical challenges effectively.

#### Course Delivery

The course will be delivered in-person. There will be a significant practical element to the course and we will be working online in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notebooks.

#### Course Requirements

- Laptop capable of connecting to the internet with a modern browser.
- Familiarity with python programming basics.

#### Please cancel if you cannot attend

We are delighted to be able to make free at point of use training available to the research community, to enable better 
software and more open, reproducible research. However, free at point of use training is not free. The cost 
of a course can easily run to thousands of pounds, if preparation costs are taken into account.

If you sign up for a course, please make sure you either attend or cancel your booking. Bookings can usually be 
cancelled through myDevelopment or, failing that, by emailing n.g.gyenge@sheffield.ac.uk.

Running courses that are not fully attended wastes our funding (which is provided by taxpayers, 
charities and students, amongst others) and reduces our collective capacity to improve research 
outputs and researcher experiences.

Persistent failure to attend booked courses might result in you being excluded from future training opportunities.

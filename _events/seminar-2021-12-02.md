**This event is being run by the Testing Research Group**

Software developers use Stack Overflow to interact and exchange code snippets and research uses Stack Overflow to harvest code snippets for use with recommendation systems. However, code on Stack Overflow may have quality issues, such as security or license problems. In this talk I will present our work on how users of Stack Overflow perceive such issues, how we studied the problem of outdated code and potential license violations, and how code is non-compliant with coding style. The prevalence of such toxic code may affect mining or machine learning tasks using Stack Overflow as a code base.

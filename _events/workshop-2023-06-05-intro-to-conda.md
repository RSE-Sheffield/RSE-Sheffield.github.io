## How can we undertake research work in a consistent and reproducible computing environment?

**This is an intermediate course, teaching the use of Conda virtual environments for reproducible research environments.**


*This event is for University of Sheffield researchers and research students only. Please register with a
University of Sheffield email address to ensure your ticket request is accepted.*


### Prerequisite skills

- Basic shell commands (bash/zsh (Linux/MacOS); Powershell (Windows)).
- Some Python programming experience.

### Learning Objectives

- Understand what Conda is and why it is useful for managing packages and environments in research workflows.
- How to create, activate and delete Conda environments.
- How to install and manage packages in Conda environments.
- What Conda channels and packages are and how to use them.
- How to use pip in Conda environments.
- How to share your Conda environment.

This course will be run online via the Blackboard Virtual Learning Environment.


### Setup

Prior to attending, you need to install the software we are going to use. **Please ensure you have completed setup
before the course begins**.

Instructions on how to install all the software required can be found on the [Setup
chapter](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/introduction-to-conda-for-data-scientists/setup/) of the course materials. If you have
any problems with your setup, please get in touch with us for assistance *before* the course begins.

We are delighted to be able to make free at point of use training available to the research community, to enable better
software and more open, reproducible research. However, **free at point of use training is not free**. The cost of a
course can easily run to thousands of pounds, if preparation costs are taken into account.


**If you sign up for a course, please make sure you either attend or cancel your booking.** Bookings can usually be
cancelled using [eventbrite.com](https://www.eventbrite.com) or, failing that, by emailing
[rse@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:rse@sheffield.ac.uk).


Running courses that are not fully attended wastes our funding (which is provided by taxpayers, charities and students,
amongst others) and reduces our collective capacity to improve research outputs and researcher experiences.


Persistent failure to attend booked courses might result in you being excluded from future training opportunities.

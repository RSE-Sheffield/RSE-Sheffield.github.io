# Supercharge your research code with Git and GitHub

Git and GitHub have become essential tools in programming.
In this practical workshop, we will begin to learn how to use them for managing your code projects,
developing rapidly and safely on branches, tracking changes to your code and using GitHub for collaborative development, 
remote backups and distributing your code openly.

## Who is this lesson for?
Any researchers who write code will find something in this lesson that they will benefit from.
Whether you're a new PhD student, Postdoc, Fellow or Academic, it's always a good time to learn about source code management and version control with git. Once you've learned these skills, you'll never look back.

## What will we learn?
We'll be working from the [Carpentries lesson on Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).
This lesson includes:
    * Tracking the changes that are made to your code,
    * Recovering older versions of files,
    * Work on new ideas safely using branches, without messing up your working code,
    * Sending your changes to GitHub,
    * Working collaboratively,
    * Making your work more open,
    * Licensing your code.

## How will it be taught?
This will be a practical online workshop in which you'll work through exercises along with the instructors.

## Prerequisite knowledge
In this lesson we use Git from the Unix Shell. Some previous experience with the shell is expected, but isnâ€™t _mandatory_.
There are some shell lessons scheduled, but if you'd like to brush up, we'd recommend [the Carpentries lesson on the Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).

Note, that if you would prefer to use git from a graphical user interface, the Research Software Engineering Team at the University of Sheffield teach a workshop using GitKraken client. Look out for upcoming workshops at <https://rse.shef.ac.uk>

## Technical Requirements
Users of Windows, MacOS or any Linux distribution can take part in this course. If at all possible, we recommend using two monitors if you have them available. Some software may need to be installed prior to the course, instructions will be circulated to attendees beforehand.


## Statement on free at point of use training

We are delighted to be able to make free at point of use training available to the research community, to enable better software and more open, reproducible research. However, free at point of use training is not free. The cost of a course can easily run to thousands of pounds, if preparation costs are taken into account.

If you sign up for a course, please make sure you either attend or cancel your booking. Bookings can usually be cancelled using eventbrite.com or, failing that, by emailing rse@sheffield.ac.uk.

Running courses that are not fully attended wastes our funding (which is provided by taxpayers, charities and students, amongst others) and reduces our collective capacity to improve research outputs and researcher experiences.

Persistent failure to attend booked courses might result in you being excluded from future training opportunities.

Following the success of our 2019 event,
the University of Sheffield and NVIDIA are pleased to announce that we will be hosting a 2020 GPU Hackathon
as part of the NVIDIA international GPU Hackathon Series.

This event will take place between **27 â€“ 31 July 2020**,
most likely as an online event unless government restrictions around COVID-19 are significantly altered.

For more information on the event see [this blog post](/blog/2020-04-06-announce-gpu-hackathon-2020/).

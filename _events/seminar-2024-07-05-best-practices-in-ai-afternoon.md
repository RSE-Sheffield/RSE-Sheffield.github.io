## Overview
We are excited to present Best Practices in AI Afternoon which will be held on the **5th of July, 12-5pm at
Workroom 2, 38 Mappin, Sheffield, S1 4DT**.
The afternoon will consist of talks, walkthroughs and demos on best practices for research, design, development,
and deployment of AI systems. There will be a focus on practical aspects such as tooling, processes, tips,
tricks, & gotchas that attendees can incorporate into their existing research!

**Buffet lunch and coffee will be provided, with a drinks reception sponsored by Nvidia after the event.**

This event is held in collaboration between the **[Research Software Engineering (RSE)](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/)** group
and the [**Centre for Machine Intelligence (CMI)**](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/machine-intelligence) in the University of Sheffield.

      <div class="speaker"><img class="align-self-center mr-2" src="/assets/images/icons/icons8-communication-skill-50.png" width="20" alt="Speaker">Karin Sevegnani, Senior Solutions Architect, Nvidia</div>
      <div class="description">In this talk, we will explore the intricate balance between computational resources, memory limitations, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques in large language models (LLMs). We will analyse strategies to optimize the performance of LLMs while managing these constraints effectively. From efficient memory utilization to streamlined parameter fine-tuning methods, we will discuss practical approaches to maximize the efficiency of LLMs without sacrificing performance.</div>

      <div class="speaker"><img class="align-self-center mr-2" src="/assets/images/icons/icons8-communication-skill-50.png" width="20" alt="Speaker">Ryan Daniels, University of Cambridge</div>
      <div class="description">Writing research software in Python presents numerous challenges to reproducibility - what version of Python is being used? What about the versions of PyTorch, Scikit Learn or Numpy? Should we use Conda, or venv, or Poetry to manage dependencies and environments? How can we control randomness? Do I have the right version of Cuda Toolkit? In principle, given the same data, and same algorithms and methodology, we should be able to reproduce the results of any given experiment to within an acceptable degree of error. Dealing with the above questions introduces significant problems to reproducing experiments in machine learning. In this talk, I would like to convince you that Docker can help alleviate almost all of these questions. Furthermore, combining Docker, git and GitHub can be a powerful workflow, helping to minimise your tech stack, and declutter your python development experience.</div>

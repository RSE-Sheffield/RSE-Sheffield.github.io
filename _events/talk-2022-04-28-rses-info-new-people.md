This session, *aimed at people newly joining the University of Sheffield as academics*, will introduce the RSE Team. We will cover:

* Why there is an RSE Team at the University of Sheffield:
  * External drivers including UKRI focus on open and reproducible research, and high profile research software failures.
  * Improving RSE careers.
  * Facilitating access by research projects to software engineering skills.
  * Our sustainable funding model.
* What the RSE Team does:
  * Implementing good practice (e.g. testing, version control, documentation).
  * Software development in Python, R, Matlab, C, etc.
  * Improving software performance.
  * Packaging and managing dependencies.
* How to access free at point of use help via [Code Clinics](https://goo.gl/forms/5MVy0jM6xQhWlpmn1).
* How to engage with the RSE Community.
* How to collaborate with the RSE Team on funded projects (e.g. by adding a percentage of an RSE to as grant application).

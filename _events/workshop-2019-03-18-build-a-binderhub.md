Funders and publishers are beginning to require that publications include access to the underlying data and the analysis code.
Researchers can be supported in doing this through [myBinder.org][mb] which 
allows you to share your software with others in the form of a single clickable link, 
making it easier for users and removing the need for you to worry about supporting lots of different platforms. 
This is a huge step forward in terms of supporting reproducibility but the public Binder instance, [myBinder.org][mb], requires 
all code and data to be fully open, and computational power and data storage is limited. 
One solution to this is to host your own [BinderHub][bh] locally, 
allowing you to control who has access to code and data and to provide greater computational power.

During this free workshop we will demonstrate how to build your own BinderHub on Microsoft Azure cloud computing resources. 
We will help you get started with building a BinderHub on your institution's computing platform and 
discuss the challenges of maintaining a BinderHub. 
At the end of the workshop you will know why this would be a useful resource for your team, and 
will know where to look for help and support building your institution's BinderHub.

This workshop is for Research Software Engineers and IT staff who are:

 * Interested in reproducibility, containers, Docker or continuous integration;
 * Already familiar with Binder and R Markdown or Python for data science;
 * Interested in setting up their own local BinderHub.

## The Turing Way 

This workshop is being run by The Turing Way project team. 
The Turing Way is a handbook to support students, their supervisors, funders and journal editors in 
ensuring that reproducible data science is "too easy not to do". 
It is openly developed and any and all questions, comments and recommendations are welcome at our GitHub repository: 

[https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way)

or in our [gitter](https://gitter.im/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) chat room. 
Our interdisciplinary team includes data scientists, research software engineers and librarians. 
We are all motivated to ensure that all results can be independently verified and built upon in future work and 
want to help as many people learn the skills and tools required to do so. 
We hope that workshop participants will also contribute their "tips and tricks" on using Binder to the book to share what they've learned with others.

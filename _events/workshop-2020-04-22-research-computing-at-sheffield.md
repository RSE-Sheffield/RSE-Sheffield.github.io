**UPDATE: this event has been cancelled.  A smaller-scale online event may be run instead.  Keep an eye out for updates from IT Services and/or the RSE team regarding this.**

Robert Chisholm and Bob Turner from the RSE team are going to be speaking at this event. Robert's talk is "Accelerating the modelling of tumour growth using GPUs: lessons learned" and Bob's is "Infrastructure and Configuration as Code".

This event presents aspects of research computing within the University from standard desktop to high performance computing applications, using open source and commercial code, for statistical analyses, bioinformatics, engineering simulations, medical applications and deep learning. The day will consist of talks, including an update from the N8 CIR (N8 Centre of Excellence in Computationally Intensive Research), computational workflow walk-throughs and an opportunity to take part in two "lightning talk" sessions (register for your 2 minute research computing plug on the day).

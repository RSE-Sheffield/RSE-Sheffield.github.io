The HPC training workshop is an intensive two-day workshop sponsored by [N8 CIR](https://n8cir.org.uk/) (N8 Centre of Excellence in Computationally Intensive Research) that will be run in collaboration with [Women In HPC (WHPC)](https://womeninhpc.org/) organization and [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/). This course introduces the basics of High-Performance Computing (HPC) and how to access these resources via the command line. After completing this course, participants will:

- Understand motivations for using HPC in research
- Understand how HPC systems are put together to achieve performance and how they differ from desktops/laptops
- Know how to connect to remote HPC systems and transfer data
- Be able to use the Bash command line on remote systems
- Know how to use a scheduler to work on a shared system
- Be able to use software modules to access different HPC software
- Be able to work effectively on a remote shared resource

More detail on schedule and setup instructions can be found in [part 1](https://aniabrown.github.io/hpc-carpentry-shell-WHPC/) and [part 2](https://aniabrown.github.io/hpc-carpentry-WHPC/) of the course.

_Lunch and refreshments will be provided._

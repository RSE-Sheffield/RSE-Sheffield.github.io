**Abstract**: Developing high performance codes, especially parallel codes can be a complex and
time consuming process. In this talk I will describe the general process of taking a serial code or
algorithm and developing a high performance parallel version using modern techniques and libraries,
using my own projects as examples. I will discuss some of the available high level frameworks
available in several languages and their advantages and drawbacks, and compare this to more
traditional low level development using MPI or CUDA. Following this I will describe methods for
testing, benchmarking and profiling of HPC codes using open source tools and free services. Finally
I will discuss strategies for ensuring that software is sustainably developed to ensure that it is
straightforwardly portable to other hardware and easily accessible to other users.

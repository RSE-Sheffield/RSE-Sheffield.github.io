[**Register Here** via Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/plotting-and-programming-with-python-tickets-609605936767)

Please note that this workshop will take place over 2 days from from 2-5pm on 9th May and 1-5pm on 10th May.

## Who is this lesson for?
This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python 3 for people with little or no previous programming experience. It uses plotting as its motivating example but will teach you the essential foundations of programming in python.

## What will we learn?
This workshop will use [software carpentry's plotting and programming in python lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) which includes everything you need to get started with python via sections on:
- variables
- data types
- functions
- libraries/packages
- tabular data with pandas
- plotting
- lists
- for loops
- conditionals

## How will it be taught?
This will be a practical and hands on, in-person workshop lead by expert instructors.

## Prerequisite knowledge
No previous programming experience is required but you should have some knowledge of files and directories/folders.

## Technical Requirements
You will need to install some software, all major operating systems (windows, macos and linux) are suitable and instructions will be send out prior to the workshop.

## Statement on free at point of use training

We are delighted to be able to make free at point of use training available to the research community, to enable better software and more open, reproducible research. However, free at point of use training is not free. The cost of a course can easily run to thousands of pounds, if preparation costs are taken into account.

If you sign up for a course, please make sure you either attend or cancel your booking. Bookings can usually be cancelled using eventbrite.com or, failing that, by emailing rse@sheffield.ac.uk.

Running courses that are not fully attended wastes our funding (which is provided by taxpayers, charities and students, amongst others) and reduces our collective capacity to improve research outputs and researcher experiences.

Persistent failure to attend booked courses might result in you being excluded from future training opportunities.

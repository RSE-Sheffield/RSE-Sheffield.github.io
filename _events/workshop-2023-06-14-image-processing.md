_This workshop is for University of Sheffield researchers. Please ensure that you sign up using a University of Sheffield email address so that your booking is accepted._

**Note** This event will take place over two days 14th & 16th June from 10am to 4pm each day.

This workshop uses Python and a variety of example images to teach the foundational concepts of image processing, and the skills needed to programmatically extract information from image data. 

## What will we learn?
This lesson will be taught from [the data carpentry Image Processing with Python lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/image-processing/) and includes:
- Scikit-image
- Masking
- Histograms
- Blurring
- Thresholding
- Automatic counting

## How will it be taught?
This will be a practical, hands-on in-person workshop lead by expert instructors.

## Prerequisite knowledge
This lesson assumes you have a working knowledge of Python and some previous exposure to the Bash shell.
Workshops are currently scheduled on the following dates:
 - Python: 9-10 May
 - Shell: 13 June

## Technical Requirements
This lesson uses python, scikit-image. Installation instructions will be circulated prior. All major operating systems are suitable for this lesson.

## Statement on free at point of use training

We are delighted to be able to make free at point of use training available to the research community, to enable better software and more open, reproducible research. However, free at point of use training is not free. The cost of a course can easily run to thousands of pounds, if preparation costs are taken into account.

If you sign up for a course, please make sure you either attend or cancel your booking. Bookings can usually be cancelled using eventbrite.com or, failing that, by emailing rse@sheffield.ac.uk.

Running courses that are not fully attended wastes our funding (which is provided by taxpayers, charities and students, amongst others) and reduces our collective capacity to improve research outputs and researcher experiences.

Persistent failure to attend booked courses might result in you being excluded from future training opportunities.

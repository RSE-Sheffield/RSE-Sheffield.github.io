#### Course Description

Recent advances in deep neural networks coupled with an increasing amount and complexity of scientific data collected in a wide array of domains provide many [exciting opportunities for deep learning applications in scientific settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11755). Furthermore, libraries such as Google’s Tensorflow python library have made building deep learning models more accessible through common tools, freely available to researchers.

In this course, we’ll introduce some basic neural network and deep learning theory and give participants practical experience in some popular deep learning models and techniques.

**Content includes:**

- Introduction to Regression and Classification using neural networks
- Image classification with Convolutional neural networks
- Speeding up the training process of your own models using existing neural network

#### Course Delivery

The course will be delivered online through blackboard collaborate. There will be a significant practical element to the course and we will be working online in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notebooks.

#### Course Requirements

Familiarity with python programming basics.

#### Please cancel if you cannot attend

We are delighted to be able to make free at point of use training available to the research community, to enable better software and more open, reproducible research. However, free at point of use training is not free. The cost of a course can easily run to thousands of pounds, if preparation costs are taken into account.

If you sign up for a course, please make sure you either attend or cancel your booking. Bookings can usually be cancelled using eventbrite.com or, failing that, by emailing rse@sheffield.ac.uk.

Running courses that are not fully attended wastes our funding (which is provided by taxpayers, charities and students, amongst others) and reduces our collective capacity to improve research outputs and researcher experiences.

Persistent failure to attend booked courses might result in you being excluded from future training opportunities.

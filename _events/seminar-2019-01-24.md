**Abstract**: The theory seminar group in the Department of Physics invited RSE Sheffield to give a talk on code optimisation.  We took this opportunity to stress the importance of ensuring, using tests, that code is correct before and after optimisation and the value of profiling methods and tools to ensure that optimisation efforts are precisely targetted.  We finished the talk by focussing on the things that most greatly contribute to software being sustainble: version control, test frameworks and automated testing and good documentation.

**Bio**: Phil and Will are Research Software Engineers in the University of Sheffieldâ€™s RSE group.

The Gaussian Process Summer Schools are a series of schools and workshops aimed at researchers who want to understand and use Gaussian process models, both in theory and practice. They are organised by the [Sheffield Machine Learning Group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/machine-learning) and others.

**The Gaussian Process Summer School will be a virtual event from Monday September, 13 2021 to Thursday September, 16 2021.**

For the event, we will use Zoom. If you have already registered, we will contact you close to the beginning of the School with instructions about how to connect. The School will include round table sessions with the speakers where participants can interact with them.

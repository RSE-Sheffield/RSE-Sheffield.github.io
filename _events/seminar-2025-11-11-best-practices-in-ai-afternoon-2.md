## Overview

We are excited to present the Best Practices in AI Afternoon 2 which will be held on the **11th of November, 12-5pm at
Design Studio 01 (D05), Pam Liversidge Building, Broad Lane, S1 3JD**.

The afternoon will consist of talks and walkthroughs on best practices for research, design, development,
and deployment of AI. It will focus on practical aspects such as tooling, optimisation, profiling, tips and tricks to
supercharge AI in your research!

**Buffet lunch and coffee will be provided.**

This event is held in collaboration between the **[Research Software Engineering (RSE)](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/)** group
and the [**Centre for Machine Intelligence (CMI)**](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/machine-intelligence) in the University
of Sheffield, and the [N8 CIR](https://n8cir.org.uk/).

GenAI in their own research. This talk will outline the thinking behind the University Principles and how they might 
be applied in research practice, and will highlight current developments around AI use in the wider national

      <div class="description">
To use visualization effectively in explainable AI (XAI), you first need to identify: 
(a) the XAI tasks you are performing, (b) specific questions you want to answer, and (c) 
the data types that are involved. In this talk, I will illustrate how different visualization techniques map to a wide 
range of XAI tasks and questions. Some of the visualization techniques are well-known (e.g., scatterplots, bar charts 
and heat maps) but others are more unusual (e.g., violin plots, beeswarm plots and parallel coordinates). 
I will also show you how to avoid being misled by visualizations and some common bloopers.

## Speaker Profiles

### Shaun Donnelly, University of Sheffield

Shaun is a research software engineer at the University of Sheffield with a background in astrochemistry and
AI-driven computational chemistry. Since joining the RSE team in December 2024, he's been exploring
how large language models can transform research workflows, from Retrieval Augmented Generation to tool-driven
Agentic AI. He's particularly interested in exploring how to make research software more accessible by the use of
natural language as an interface between researchers, their software and their research workflows.

### Denis Newman-Griffis, University of Sheffield

Denis Newman-Griffis (they/them) is a Senior Lecturer in the School of Computer Science and Theme Lead for AI-Enabled
Research in the University of Sheffield's Centre for Machine Intelligence. Their award-winning work investigates the
responsible use of AI for human flourishing, including pioneering work on responsible AI in research funding and
assessment, ethical practice for AI in policy and public services, and critical perspectives on AI for health and
disability. Denis is a British Academy Innovation Fellow and a former Research Fellow of the Research on Research
Institute.

### Anna Louise Ollerenshaw, Nvidia

Anna Ollerenshaw is a Solutions Architect supporting partners by delivering AI/deep learning solutions. She specialises
in conversational AI, particularly speech technology, LLMs, data curation and retrieval augmented generation systems.
She has several years experience working in engineering and automation across aerospace, manufacturing and defence, and
received her PhD in End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) from the University of Sheffield.

### Mozhgan Kabiri Chimeh

science workflows. His Leeds Virtual Microscope (LVM) has been commercialised by the healthcare company Roche and
was a [REF2021 Impact Case Study](https://results2021.ref.ac.uk/impact/54f55ced-71f6-4e6d-9281-e065e7147f3e?page=1).
He was an Alan Turing Institute Fellow from 2018 – 2023, and is currently principal investigator on two major
projects: Making Visualization Scalable ([MAVIS](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FX029689%2F1)) for explainable
AI (funded by the EPSRC) and AI for Dynamic prescribing optimisation and care integration in
multimorbidity ([DynAIRx](https://fundingawards.nihr.ac.uk/award/NIHR203986); funded by the NIHR). He has published
a practitioner’s guide for rigorously and efficiently checking data quality
([https://doi.org/10.5518/1481](https://doi.org/10.5518/1481)) and an associated software package as
open source ([https://pypi.org/project/vizdataquality/](https://pypi.org/project/vizdataquality/)).

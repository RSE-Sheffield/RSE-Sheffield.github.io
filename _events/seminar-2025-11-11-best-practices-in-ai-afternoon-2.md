evolving. The University of Sheffield has recently developed a set of Principles for Using GenAI in Research and 
Innovation, which aim to provide a starting point for students and staff at the university exploring the use of 
GenAI in their own research. This talk will outline the thinking behind the University Principles and how they might 
be applied in research practice, and will highlight current developments around AI use in the wider national 
and international research systems.</div>

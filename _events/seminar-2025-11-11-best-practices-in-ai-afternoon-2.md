## Overview

We are excited to present the Best Practices in AI Afternoon 2 which will be held on the **11th of November, 12-5pm at
Design Studio 01 (D05), Pam Liversidge Building, Broad Lane, S1 3JD**.

The afternoon will consist of talks and walkthroughs on best practices for research, design, development,
and deployment of AI. It will focus on practical aspects such as tooling, optimisation, profiling, tips and tricks to
supercharge AI in your research!

**Buffet lunch and coffee will be provided.**

This event is held in collaboration between the **[Research Software Engineering (RSE)](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/)** group
and the [**Centre for Machine Intelligence (CMI)**](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/machine-intelligence) in the University
of Sheffield, and the [N8 CIR](https://n8cir.org.uk/).

      <div class="description">
To use visualization effectively in explainable AI (XAI), you first need to identify: 
(a) the XAI tasks you are performing, (b) specific questions you want to answer, and (c) 
the data types that are involved. In this talk, I will illustrate how different visualization techniques map to a wide 
range of XAI tasks and questions. Some of the visualization techniques are well-known (e.g., scatterplots, bar charts 
and heat maps) but others are more unusual (e.g., violin plots, beeswarm plots and parallel coordinates). 
I will also show you how to avoid being misled by visualizations and some common bloopers.

## Speaker Profiles

### Denis Newman-Griffis, University of Sheffield
Denis Newman-Griffis (they/them) is a Senior Lecturer in the School of Computer Science and Theme Lead for AI-Enabled
Research in the University of Sheffield's Centre for Machine Intelligence. Their award-winning work investigates the
responsible use of AI for human flourishing, including pioneering work on responsible AI in research funding and
assessment, ethical practice for AI in policy and public services, and critical perspectives on AI for health and
disability. Denis is a British Academy Innovation Fellow and a former Research Fellow of the Research on Research
Institute.

### Shaun Donnelly, University of Sheffield
Shaun is a research software engineer at the University of Sheffield with a background in astrochemistry and
AI-driven computational chemistry. Since joining the RSE team in December 2024, he's been exploring
how large language models can transform research workflows, from Retrieval Augmented Generation to tool-driven
Agentic AI. He's particularly interested in exploring how to make research software more accessible by the use of
natural language as an interface between researchers, their software and their research workflows.

### Su Golder, University of York
Su is an Associate Professor in the Department of Health Sciences. She has a background as an information specialist
with over 25 years' experience in literature searching. She has specialist expertise in systematic review
methodology - including automation and AI, systematic reviews of adverse effects, and using social media as a
data source. During her post-doctoral NIHR (National Institute for Health Research) fellowship she has expanded on
her work in her PhD by investigating the use of unpublished data, text mining and social media in the retrieval of
adverse effects data. In her current research she continues to undertake systematic reviews, develop systematic
review methodology, conduct network analyses and to use social media to gain wider information as well as
healthcare user and provider perspectives. She is currently an elective member of the Cochrane Methods Executive
and one of the founders and co-convenors of the Cochrane Adverse Effects Methods Group.

### Roy Ruddle, University of Leeds
[Roy Ruddle](https://raruddle.wordpress.com/) is a Professor of Computing at the University of Leeds, and 
Director of Research Technology at the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics (LIDA). Roy has worked in both industry

science workflows. His Leeds Virtual Microscope (LVM) has been commercialised by the healthcare company Roche and 
was a [REF2021 Impact Case Study](https://results2021.ref.ac.uk/impact/54f55ced-71f6-4e6d-9281-e065e7147f3e?page=1). 
He was an Alan Turing Institute Fellow from 2018 – 2023, and is currently principal investigator on two major 
projects: Making Visualization Scalable ([MAVIS](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FX029689%2F1)) for explainable 
AI (funded by the EPSRC) and AI for Dynamic prescribing optimisation and care integration in 
multimorbidity ([DynAIRx](https://fundingawards.nihr.ac.uk/award/NIHR203986); funded by the NIHR). He has published 
a practitioner’s guide for rigorously and efficiently checking data quality 
([https://doi.org/10.5518/1481](https://doi.org/10.5518/1481)) and an associated software package as 
open source ([https://pypi.org/project/vizdataquality/](https://pypi.org/project/vizdataquality/)).

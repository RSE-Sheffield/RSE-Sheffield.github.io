GPU computing offers great benefits to simulation performance, but can certainly be intimidating to get to grips with! Join us for a set of short talks describing projects in which the GPU programming aspect has been made more portable in some way, whether through alternative language bindings, or cross-platform portability.

Each talk will be ~10 minutes, leaving roughly 20 minutes for discussion/questions.

This session will take place on Google Meet and participants can join 15 mins before the start of the session.

Joining information will be available shortly!

GPU computing offers great benefits to simulation performance, but can certainly be intimidating to get to grips with! Join us for a set of short talks describing projects in which the GPU programming aspect has been made more portable in some way, whether through alternative language bindings, or cross-platform portability.

Each talk will be ~10 minutes, leaving roughly 20 minutes for discussion/questions.

This session will take place on [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/sqk-bdmi-tjq) and participants can join 15 mins before the start of the session.

We also have a [Google Jam Board](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1Z6kZfJIabiWX31KgtEl6yoCo1Tlb4cRXgxUuFyqozEM/edit?usp=sharing) where you can note down any questions or comments before or during the event.

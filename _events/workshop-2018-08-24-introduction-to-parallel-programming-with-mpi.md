If you want your code to scale to 100s or even 1000s of CPU cores then [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) is the traditional way to do it and is the dominant programming model used in High Performance Computing.  Delivered by Jon Gibson of the [Numerical Algorithms Group](https://www.nag.co.uk/) (NAG).

As code and software become an ever bigger part of research (its likely that [around 1/3 of researchers write
code](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/sssurvey/)), coding and other digital skills become ever more important to researchers. The
FAIR for Research Software Principles adapted the _FAIR Guiding Principles for Scientific Data
Management and Stewardship_  to Research Software and provide a framework for the development of code and
software. The range of skills involved in adopting this paradigm shift is diverse and together the  Research Software
Engineering (RSE), Data Analytics Service (DAS) and Library teams have developed the FAIR<sup>2</sup> Training Programme
which covers most aspects of the training required.

In this LunchBytes session, Dr Romain Thomas, Head of Research Software Engineering, will give an overview of the
motivation behind the programmes development and introduce the curriculum covered by the FAIR<sup>2</sup> Training
Programme, explaining the modular structure of the material and how components build on and are linked to each other.

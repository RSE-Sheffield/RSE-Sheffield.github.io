R and its ecosystem of packages offers a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques and is increasing in popularity as the tool of choice for data analysis in academia.
In addition to its powerful analytical features, the R ecosystem provides a large number of tools and conventions to help support more open, robust and reproducible research. This includes tools for managing research projects, building robust analysis workflows, documenting data and code, testing code and disseminating and sharing analyses.
In this talk we’ll take a whistle-stop tour of the breadth of available tools, demonstrating the ways R and the Rstudio integrated development environment can be used to underpin more open reproducible research and facilitate best practice

### Speaker Bio

Anna is a Research Software Engineer (RSE) at the University of Sheffield with a background in Marine Macroecology and research software development in R. She is part of a team of RSEs working to help researchers build more robust analysis pipelines and software, promote best practice in research programming and digital resource management and facilitate the shift to more open, transparent and collaborative research culture.  She is also an editor for rOpenSci, a 2019 Software Sustainability Institute Fellow and a member of the ReproHack core team. Overall, her passion lies in helping researchers and the research community as a whole make better use of the real workhorses of research, code and data, and in spreading the word about the joys of R.

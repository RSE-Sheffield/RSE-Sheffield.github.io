Data Conversations are a chance for researchers and professional services
staff to come together and discuss their research data and current issues
in research data management. There will be presenters from across the
University, as well as plenty of time to meet and chat with colleagues.

Our first 'Data Conversation', to celebrate Love Data Week, will focus on
the benefits and challenges of data visualisation for researchers.

Data visualisations allow research to be more easily explored, evaluated
and understood than by looking at the raw data alone. Visualisations can
help communicate research to new audiences, highlight trends during the
early, exploratory stages of a research project, and make sense of big
datasets.

Speakers will include:

  * Alasdair Rae (Urban Studies and Planning)
  * Colin Angus (SCHARR)
  * Charlotte Tomkins (History), Charles West (History), and Tom Stafford (Psychology)

The Library, CiCS and the Research Software Engineering team have recently
begun to develop new services to support data visualisation and there will be a
chance for researchers to feed back on what services they would like to see in
the future.

If you find yourself running simulations that take days, struggling to fit datasets in your computer's memory, training deep
learning models or wish you had more computational resource for doing research, HPC might be the solution!

A High Performance Computing (HPC) Cluster is a network of computers with a lot of CPUs, RAM and hard disk space. At 
Sheffield, we offer access to many HPC systems locally and externally which are free at point of use to all researchers 
and academics.

This session will take place on [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/uzu-jfvm-fqv) and participants can join 15 minutes before the start of the session.

We also have a [Google Jam Board](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1DYU0QM5RdJF5c-jtsRqwKQM8cAMgiUVvt_4_d9_aBNw/edit?usp=sharing) where you can note down any questions or comments before or during the event.

#### HPC at Sheffield and Beyond: Overview

Speaker: *Twin Karmakharm*

This talk gives an overview of what a HPC is, what it's used for, why you'd want to use it and the systems available to 
Sheffield researchers and academics.

#### HPC Beyond Sheffield: JADE and Bede

Speaker: *Peter Heywood*

Alongside the local HPC facilities at The University of Sheffield, researchers can also access regional Tier-2 HPC facilities in the UK.
This talk will describe the Tier-2 HPC systems available to TUoS researchers, why using Tier-2 HPC can be beneficial and how these systems can be accessed and used.
There will be a focus on the JADE and Bede GPU-based Tier 2 systems which TUoS is affiliated with.

If you find yourself running simulations that take days, struggling to fit datasets in your computer's memory, training deep
learning models or wish you had more computational resource for doing research, HPC might be the solution! 

A High Performance Computing (HPC) Cluster is a network of computers with a lot of CPUs, RAM and hard disk space. At 
Sheffield, we offer access to many HPC systems locally and externally which are free at point of use to all researchers 
and academics. Come join us to find out more about these systems and how you can get access.

More details TBD. Save the date!

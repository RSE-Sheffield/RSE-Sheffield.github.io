In this edition of LunchBytes, we'll be getting together to show off our favourite tools that help with using _git_ and _GitHub_ 

Think: command line tools, IDE plugins, GitHub/Lab features etc.

If you have a git tool you'd like to let others know about - get in touch with the host at **_d.wilby [at] sheffield.ac.uk_**

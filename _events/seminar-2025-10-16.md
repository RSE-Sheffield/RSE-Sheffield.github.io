As code and software become an ever bigger part of research (it's likely that [around 1/3 of researchers write
code](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/sssurvey/)), coding and other digital skills become ever more important to researchers. The
FAIR for Research Software Principles adapt the _FAIR Guiding Principles for Scientific Data Management and Stewardship_
to Research Software and provide a framework for the development of code and software. The range of skills involved in
adopting this paradigm shift is diverse and together the Research Software Engineering (RSE), Data Analytics Service
(DAS) and Library teams have developed the [FAIR<sup>2</sup> for Research
Software](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/training/fair4rs/) programme which covers most aspects of the training required.

In this online session, Dr Romain Thomas, Head of Research Software Engineering, will give an overview of the motivation
behind the programme's development and introduce the curriculum covered by the FAIR<sup>2</sup> for Research Software
programme, explaining the modular structure of the material and how components build on and are linked to each other.

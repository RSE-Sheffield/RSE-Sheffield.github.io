#### FORGE provides short, focused RSE support to help researchers improve the quality, performance, and sustainability of their research software.

### About the FORGE Programme

The RSE FORGE (FOcused Research software Guidance and Enhancement) programme delivers targeted improvements to research software through intensive two day projects. Each project provides two RSEs working full time for two days on your research software. FORGE is designed for researchers with functional code who want to tackle/identify performance issues, improve code structure, package their software for publication, or get an expert review. Projects are free and available to all research active staff at the University of Sheffield.

#### Project Scope

FORGE projects are intended to be short, self-contained pieces of work. Suitable project types include:

- **Optimisation:** Improving the performance or efficiency of existing code. Examples include improved data processing, reduced memory usage in large scale simulations, or identifying bottlenecks.
- **Refactoring:** Restructuring code for improved maintainability and readability. This might involve modularising code, improving code organisation, or implementing design patterns appropriate to your research domain.
- **Packaging and publication:** Preparing code for distribution on package repositories like PyPI, or preparing code for public release on GitHub with appropriate licensing and contribution guidelines.
- **Code review and general feedback:** Assessment of code quality, structure, and best practices. We can review your codebase and provide actionable recommendations for improvements in testing, documentation, or architecture.
- **ML/AI workflows:** Guidance on implementing or improving machine learning pipelines, model deployment, hyperparameter optimisation, or integrating modern ML frameworks into your research workflow.

Applicants should **select one area of focus** for their project.

#### Eligibility Criteria

To be eligible for a FORGE project, applicants must:

- Be a research active member of staff affiliated to the University of Sheffield.
- Have existing code that is functional and produces research outputs.
- Ensure the code is (or will be made) publicly accessible and freely downloadable.
- Provide clear instructions or objectives for what they want to achieve.

### Application and Selection

FORGE projects will take place in three windows throughout the year. After the application deadline passes your application will be assessed by a panel consisting of members of the RSE team and DAS. The criteria for a successful project is:

- **Scope:** Does the project fit within the project scope criteria?
- **Ease of accessibility:** Is the codebase easily attainable and can it be easily and quickly explored?
- **Project Goals:** Are the project goals attainable within the 2 day window?
- **Skills:** Are there applicable skill sets within the RSE and DAS teams?

Successful projects will be notified within four weeks of the application deadline closing.

### What to Expect

Once your application is accepted, here's what the two day collaboration will look like:

**Pre-project preparation:** Before the project begins, your assigned RSEs will review your codebase and have a brief meeting to clarify objectives, technical requirements, and expected outcomes.
**Two day project:** Both RSEs work full time on your project over two consecutive days. By the end of day two, you'll receive completed code changes, documentation of improvements, and clear guidance on next steps.
**Post-project handover:** Shortly after the project, you'll have a final meeting to review all deliverables, ask questions, and discuss recommendations for future development.

#### How to Apply

You can submit an application for a FORGE project via [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/R1djFehQ9xxCBwgX9).

### Attribution and Acknowledgments

RSE contributions to your research software should be appropriately acknowledged. This helps demonstrate the value of RSE support and ensures proper credit for collaborative work. We expect:

- **Acknowledgment in publications:** if FORGE work contributes to research outputs, please acknowledge the RSE team in your papers.
- **Software citation:** if you publish or share software that incorporates FORGE contributions, appropriate citation or acknowledgment should be included in documentation.

These expectations will be clarified during the initial project meeting with guidance on attribution provided by us.

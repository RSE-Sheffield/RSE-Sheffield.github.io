Focused Optimisation and Research software Guidance Engagement

### Introduction

The RSE FORGE (Focused Optimisation and Research software Guidance Engagement) projects are free, short duration collaborations between research active staff within the University of Sheffield and Research Software Engineers (RSEs) working in the RSE team and engineers from the Data Analytics Service (DAS).

This program aims to support researchers within the University of Sheffield with software that would benefit from short focused bursts of RSE time to help refine, optimise, or package their research software.

### Project Format

Each FORGE project will receive approximately **4 days of RSE time in total**. Projects will be supported by **two RSEs**: one with relevant domain experience in the research area, and one with broader software development expertise. This pairing ensures both contextual understanding and technical rigour.

### Scope

FORGE projects are intended to be short, self-contained pieces of work. Suitable project types include:

- **Optimisation** – improving the performance or efficiency of existing code.
- **Refactoring** – restructuring code for improved maintainability and readability.
- **Packaging and publication** – preparing code for distribution on package repositories like PyPI. Preparing code for upload to GitHub to improve the accessibility of the code.
- **Code review and general feedback** – assessment of code quality, structure, and best practices
- **ML/AI workflows** – guidance on implementing or improving machine learning pipelines.

Applicants should select one area of focus for their project.

### Eligibility Criteria

To be eligible for a FORGE project, applicants must:

- Be a research active member of staff affiliated to the University of Sheffield.
- Have existing code that is functional and produces research outputs.
- Ensure the code is (or will be made) publicly accessible and freely downloadable.
- Provide clear instructions or objectives for what they want to achieve.

### Application and Selection

The call for FORGE projects will remain **open throughout the year**, with three review windows annually. Applications will be reviewed by a panel comprising RSE and DAS team members.

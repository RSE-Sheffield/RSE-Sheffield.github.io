The RSE FORGE (FOcused Research software Guidance and Enhancement) programme delivers targeted improvements to research software through intensive two day projects. Each project pairs two RSEs who work full time for two days on your research software. FORGE is designed for researchers with functional code who want to tackle/identify performance issues, improve code structure, package their software for publication, or get an expert review. Projects are free and available to all active research staff at the University of Sheffield.

#### Project Scope

FORGE projects are intended to be short, self-contained pieces of work. Suitable project types include:

- **Optimisation:** Improving the performance or efficiency of existing code. Examples include improved data processing, reduced memory usage in large scale simulations, or identifying bottlenecks.
- **Refactoring:** Restructuring code for improved maintainability and readability. This might involve modularising code, improving code organisation, or implementing design patterns appropriate to your research domain.
- **Packaging and publication:** Preparing code for distribution on package repositories like [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), or preparing code for public release on GitHub with appropriate licensing and contribution guidelines.
- **Open Sourcing Code:** Preparing a codebase for open sourcing, this includes preparing contribution guides, licensing, and upload to a publicly accessible repository.
- **Code review and general feedback:** Assessment of code quality, structure, and best practices. We can review your codebase and provide actionable recommendations for improvements in testing, documentation, or architecture.
- **ML/AI workflows:** Guidance on implementing or improving machine learning pipelines, model deployment, hyperparameter optimisation, or integrating modern ML frameworks into your research workflow.

Applicants should **select one area of focus** for their project.

#### Eligibility Criteria

To be eligible for a FORGE project, applicants must:

- RSE Team has 
- Be an active member of research staff affiliated to the University of Sheffield.
- Have existing code that is functional and produces research outputs.
- Ensure the code is (or will be made) publicly accessible and freely downloadable, closed code will be considered on a case by case basis.
- Provide clear instructions or objectives for what they want to achieve.

### Application and Selection

FORGE projects will take place in three windows throughout the year. After the application deadline passes your application will be assessed by a panel consisting of members of the RSE team and the Data Analytics Service ([DAS](https://sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/about/who-we-are-and-what-we-do)). The criteria for a successful project is:

- **Scope:** Does the project fit within the call's project scope criteria?
- **Project Goals:** Are the project goals attainable within the 2 day window?
- **Skills:** Are there applicable skill sets within the RSE and DAS teams?

Successful projects will be notified within four weeks of the application deadline closing.

The call remains open all year. After each deadline, applications go through a one-month Review and Selection process by the RSE and DAS Panel. Successful applicants receive notification and pre-project preparation before the 2-day project execution phase. Project execution windows are November-December, March-April, and June-July. The process concludes with a post-project handover." />

### What to Expect

Once your application is accepted, here's what the two day collaboration will look like:

**Pre-project preparation:** Before the project begins, your assigned RSEs will review your codebase and organise a brief meeting with you to clarify objectives, technical requirements, and expected outcomes.
**Two day project:** Both RSEs work full time on your project over two consecutive days. By the end of day two, you'll receive completed code changes, documentation of improvements, and clear guidance on next steps.
**Post-project handover:** Shortly after the project, you'll have a final meeting to review all deliverables, ask questions, and discuss recommendations for future development.

#### How to Apply

Applications are reviewed after each deadline, with successful applicants notified within four weeks. The form takes approximately 5-10 minutes to complete. You'll need to provide a brief description of your code, your objectives, and a link to your repository (if publicly available). If your code isn't publically available or on a repository please upload it to your Google Drive where possible as this may be required to work on your proposal.

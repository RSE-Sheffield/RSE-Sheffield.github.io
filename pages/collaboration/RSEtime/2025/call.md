### Rationale

#### Introduction

The University of Sheffield recognises the critical role that Research Software Engineers (RSEs) play in advancing
scientific research. The University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering (RSE) team was founded in 2016 by two
EPSRC RSE fellows to develop research software and collaborate with academics/researchers developing research
software. The team has since grown to 11 members and has engaged with all faculties at the University.  We have worked
with research teams on small internally funded projects but also with large international consortiums and
industry. Areas of expertise within the group include: code optimisation and performance, reproducibility and embedding
good software engineering practice within a project or team, developing/maintaining infrastructure, data management,
developing computational workflows, GPU computing and Deep Learning, data science/visualisation, High Performance
Computing using cloud and local/national/international systems, general software development, software/hardware interface,
development of impact case studies, consultancy, training and education delivery and support.

To support the *One University* vision and the University research community we are pleased to announce for the second
consecutive year the **2025 RSE collaboration call for proposals**. This initiative aims to facilitate access to RSE
expertise for researchers who require assistance with software development, optimization, or other computational
challenges. The 2024 call was very popular and we received 26 submissions.

#### Objective

The objective of this call is to offer dedicated RSE collaboration to researchers who may lack the resources or
expertise to effectively develop and maintain research software. By providing free access to RSE expertise, we aim to
enhance the quality, reliability, and impact of research projects across diverse disciplines.

#### Eligibility

- Any research active staff, including PDRAs, and PhD students, affiliated to the University of Sheffield can apply to
  this call.
- Projects must involve significant software development that would benefit from RSE expertise.
- Preference may be given to projects with potential high impact or those addressing pressing scientific challenges.

#### Funding and support

For this first call, the team will select two projects. **Selected proposals will receive 6 months @ 45-50% FTE of RSE
support**. The start date will be decided by the RSE team based on the project timeline and RSEs availability. The
duration of the project will not exceed 6 months but might be shortened with a higher FTE fraction (e.g. 3 months @
100%). In addition, the collaboration will be continuous and can not be split into multiple shorter, disjointed periods
of time.

### Application guidelines

An application template for this call has been prepared and is available
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yzqS8gS-iCQ4HgM3dBcYEfYsS9E1Zm28CguZrTMl22M/edit?usp=sharing). This is a
locked file so please make a copy and use it to draft your proposal. When you are ready to submit please use the
[form](https://forms.gle/UGFz35xiXXx9GtEDA). Further details about each section are given below.

- **Abstract [max 600 words]:** Provide a brief description of the research project, its objectives and the role of
  software or computation methods in achieving these objectives. As reviewers might not be expert in your field, please
  make sure that your abstract is accessible to the panel.

- **RSE support objectives [max 600 words]:** Outline the specific areas where RSE expertise is needed, such as software
  development, optimisation, debugging, use of HPC, etc… We remind you that, if selected, your project will receive 6
  months half time. You will have to take into account project onboarding at the beginning of the collaboration and
  offboarding the project where we will handover the work done back to you.

- **Expected outcome [max 300 words]:** What does a successful collaboration look like to you? Describe the anticipated
  outcomes resulting from the contribution of RSE.

- **Project risks [max 200 words]:** What issues may cause the collaboration to be unsuccessful? Briefly describe the
  potential risks to the project. (A common example: lack of data or no access to sensitive data).

- **Impact statement [max 200 words]:** Explain how access to free RSE time would benefit the project and contribute to
  its success or broader research goals.

- **Existing material [max 200 words]:** Briefly explain what existing material you already have: Data, Software,
  Documentation…

- **Preferred timeline:** what would be the ideal time distribution of the RSE.

**The application should be submitted via the [form](https://forms.gle/UGFz35xiXXx9GtEDA) no later than the 28th June
17:00 BST.**

### Review and selection process

The panel reviewing the projects will consist of members from the Research Software Engineering (RSE) team and Data
Analytics Service (DAS). The panel will gather in July where a shortlist of six proposals will be invited for a short interview.

The criteria for the selection will be the following:

- **Fit:** Request fits the objective of the call.
- **Skills:** Does the RSE team have the required skills? Are these skills available for the duration of the project?
- **Impact:** Potential Impact of the RSE work [For the project, and wider for the community.]
- **Practicality:** How easy will it be for the RSE to join the project?
- **Resource efficiency:** Is the work requested achievable in the offered time?

Selected projects will be advertised on our website (displaying a short abstract of the project).

#### Interview

The Primary Investigator, and at their discretion their co-investigators, of shortlised proposals will be invited to
attend a short interview with three members of staff from the RSE and DAS. The purpose of the interview will be to

- share with the panel the current state of the software, demonstrate how it is currently used.
- discuss the expected goals of RSE involvement and the impact it will have on the software and its users, both within
  the research group and beyond.
- consider any risks associated with undertaking the work.

### Important dates

- Call Opens: May 26th 2025
- Deadline for proposal submission: June 28th 2025
- Shortlisting for interview: July 23rd 2025
- Interview: July 27th 2025
- Notification of Decision: July 30th 2025
- Earliest start of project: September 1st 2025
- Latest start of project: February 3rd 2026

**Important Note:** While the P.I. is requested to provide an ideal starting date, the final starting date might be
different. Availability of team members depends on other projects and we will make our best to accommodate the requested
starting date. We will therefore ask the P.I.s to understand that if their project is selected, the starting date might
be different from what they have requested.

## Objective

Good software comes less from genius software engineers than from good practices, processes and relationships. Every project is different, and everyone we work with is different.
Nevertheless, since our team is working on more than 40 projects per year, the research software engineering team has set up a standard way of working on projects, including meetings, reporting and communication. 
To ensure the success of the collaboration between RSE and research teams, it is important to set up clear expectations. This document is an attempt to clarify what these expectations are and how the RSE team works.

There’s no way we’ve got this right first time! This is a working document and we welcome feedback via any of our team members or to [rse@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:rse@sheffield.ac.uk) where your message will be received by the RSE Team management. 



## What is a Research Software Engineer? {#What-is-a-RSE}

A Research Software Engineer at the University of Sheffield is a person with a wide software engineering experience in the research context.
Our team is composed of a variety of people with different backgrounds such as computer science, health, neuroscience, geophysics, environmental science, genetics, astronomy, etc… 
Some of our team members also have experience in the private sector developing software in the industrial context. 

Each of our RSEs at TUOS holds a *Researcher* contract. This means that when embedding a member of our team in your project, it is equivalent to hiring a new researcher in your team for a given amount of time.
Hence, when requesting RSE support at the University, you are starting a collaboration with a researcher specialised in software engineering and RSEs should be seen as valuable research collaborators and not only as software developers.
As researchers, they follow the [academic career pathway](https://staff.sheffield.ac.uk/reward-recognition/academic-career-pathways) for career development and it is important to understand that they need to follow the same promotion criteria as more classical researchers at the University. 


Activities carried out by the members of the RSE team are not limited to collaborating with other researchers.
Group activities and personal development are important aspects of the RSE team culture. These activities require time and the RSE management team will make sure that RSE can participate in these activities. 
While the RSEs are doing their best to juggle with multiple projects at once and to give them the time they need, It is important to emphasise that what matters is production rather than simple timekeeping. Having said that, it is also important to know that RSEs are expected to attend various team activities:

* For every RSE in the team:
  * Weekly one-on-one meetings with their direct Line manager (~30min-1h).
  * Fortnightly meeting with the HoRSE (<30minutes).
  * RSE team meetings: 60-minutes RSE group meeting every other Wednesday.
  * May be involved in some relevant scoping meetings (frequency depending on requests).
 

* In addition, senior RSEs have the following duties:
  * 60-minutes meeting with the RSE management team every other Wednesday.
  * Project scoping meeting. Depending on RSE requests and deadlines of application. In general 30-minutes meetings.
  * Kick-off and Retrospective meetings on projects (1h). The cadence of such meetings depends on the project length.
  * Weekly meeting with their report (~30min-1h)
  * Support for building promotion cases.
  * Involvement with the academic community and funding initiative (workshops, research away days, committees, funders events to advertise the team or promoting grant proposals)

In addition to these expected activities, RSE can take part in code clinics, training, conferences (e.g. the yearly RSE National conference, RSECon), self-development activities, etc… As you would expect any early career researcher to do these activities while working on their research, we will ensure that it does not take more than 5% of the project time.


## The RSE project lifecycle {#lifecyle}

The core focus of the RSE group is collaborating with researchers on various projects. In this section, we outline the entire project lifecycle as it is carried out by the RSE team.

<p align="center">

</p>

* Entry point: **Grant writing stage**
  * Usually, and it is our preferred option, researchers requiring RSE expertise will contact us when they are writing a grant proposal. At this stage, the RSE team will organise a scoping meeting with the research team to discuss the project. Before the meeting, the P.I. of the project will be requested to fill a [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqxTC1nCQltVk_-qSmv-P1h67x5IDEdUW_p8Y2uQAaBh8xVg/viewform) with information about the project. During the meeting, we will discuss the skills required by the project, how much time RSE time we estimate it will take to complete the work and a potential starting date. 
**It is also worth noting that RSEs can also be particularly valuable co-Is on grants**, for example to lead the software side of the project. In some cases, we might propose to add one of our team members as co-I on the grant if we see that it will be valuable for the research team and increase the chances of success. In that case, the RSE will help shape the research team in shaping the bid. Unless it is already agreed upon during the meeting, the RSE team will share a proposed plan with the P.I. afterward. We will always ask the P.I. to share with us their grant costing code. This helps us keep track of the potential future work and make sure that RSE are included correctly in the grants.

**Note on costing**: In general RSEs are costed on grant as an unnamed researcher at grade G7.10 (unless the RSE is a named co-I). In some cases, a day rate will have to be used instead. This depends on the funding scheme. It is also worth mentioning that if you already have some funding and would like to work with us we can also be costed post-award. 

* Start of the project: **Kickoff meeting and end-to-end report**. When your grant is funded (congratulations!) and that the starting date of the collaboration with the RSE approaches, we will organise a kickoff meeting. 
This meeting will be attended by the RSE and their line manager and by people from the research team whose work will be closely linked to the RSE’s (at least the P.I. of the project). During the meeting we will discuss the following item:
  * *Objectives and requirements of the project*. These are the general objectives of the project. What does a successful project look like to you?
  * *Configuration of the collaboration*. Who is in charge of steering the project? What is the meeting cadence
? Who is participating to the project, and with what commitment? How will everybody communicate?
  * *Outputs*. How will the work be licensed? (see section on Licence) How will the RSE be acknowledged in the research output? (see Section on RSE impact)
  * *Objectives of the RSE*. This is where we will discuss the direct objective of the RSE. You do not have to map 3 years of work but at least the first few steps. This will be completed during the project.
  * *Risks*. What could go wrong along the project? It is often useful to try to think about potential roadblocks during the project and how to mitigate them. 
  * *Technical aspects*. Do you have any on-boarding material? Who is in charge of them and how can the RSE get access to it? 

During the meeting, everything that is discussed will be recorded in the RSE [end-to-end project report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1niSMu8MPCmZx3CAspb290QCglx-CuY4Ac4LB4AhHLWo/edit?usp=sharing). The RSE working on the project is the owner of the report and will be in charge of keeping it up to date.


* **Retrospective meetings**. For a long project in particular, it is often useful to take some time along the way to take a step back and discuss how the work and the collaboration is going. This is why we will organise retrospective meetings (ideally one every six months). It will be an occasion to discuss what is going well, what is not going so well and how we can improve. For short projects, we will organise such a meeting only at the end of the project. 
 

* **End of Project**. Ultimately, the goal of the RSE work is that the work that is produced is helpful for your research. It is therefore important to make sure that at the end of the project you are handed over the complete work. Another important aspect of this handover is that you understand the work that is handed over to you. For that reason we encourage the P.I. and/or research group members to take an active part in the development of the software. 
Outputs are specific to projects and vary greatly by programming language, but have some core themes. The RSE team aspires to produce software that can be further developed with minimal or no input from the original engineer. To facilitate this we prioritise including the following in our repositories:
  * Developer and user documentation: How to build / run the software, how it is organised, what conventions have been used, what developer tools are needed e.g. to run tests.
  * Execution environment and dependencies: What operating systems will the software run on, is what other software / libraries / modules are needed, what versions, how the execution environment is described. E.g. through containerisation.
  * Appropriate automated tests: unit, regression, integration.

A final retrospective meeting will be held at the end of the project. This will help us to know what went well, what did not, and how to improve our way of working in the future.

* **Impact Enquiry**. It is important for each RSE, and for the RSE team as well, to be able to keep track of the impact of the work. For that reason, you will receive a few months after the project ends (and even 1 and 3 years after), a short message from the RSE team to understand the long term impact of the RSE team. It will be a short mail from the Head of RSE to know if the work has been used in recent publications, if it is still in use or if it has been taken further. We would appreciate it if you took time to answer this mail.


## Impact of the RSE

An RSE is an active collaborator in the research process and should be acknowledged accordingly. If an RSE has contributed to work that supports a research paper, they should be credited as a co-author, with their role highlighted in line with the journal’s guidelines. Additionally, we encourage research P.I.s to publish any code developed during the project, such as in [the Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/). 

Beyond research outputs, if an RSE has made a significant contribution to your work, please share your feedback with the RSE management team at [rse@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:rse@sheffield.ac.uk). You may also consider nominating them for a recognition award through The Deal, a great way to acknowledge staff contributions.



# RSE practices

Whilst collaborating with researchers, the RSE team endeavours to follow good practice throughout with the objective of crafting a software project that is reproducible, sustainable and produces accountable results. Ultimately, following good practice in a research software project will result in a more impactful piece of software which outlasts the project itself. In practice, this means using tools and techniques such as:
* Version control (almost always via git)
* Shared repositories
* Software testing
* Documentation (version controlled)

“Best practices” are not universally agreed upon in the software engineering community and will change over time. A thorough list of good practices for free open source software has been produced, additionally ISO standards for quality assurance exist for Systems and software engineering. These can be quite daunting and a pragmatic approach must be adapted to balance compliance with project value.

### Instructions for delivery of necessary materials to initiate project

* **Code**. The RSE team delivers code according to best practices using a collaborative version control system (preferably GitHub, but equivalent tools such as GitLab or Bitbucket can be used for established projects). At the outset of the project initial code can be provided on a secure shared resource like Google Drive however we would expect to migrate this to version control to make any changes. The RSE team can help you to do this. If you already use version control and have a private repository, you will need to add the allocated RSE as a collaborator.

* **Data**. Along with code, or for completely new software projects, it may also be necessary to provide data. Providing access to all data required by the project as soon as possible would ensure any software developed takes into consideration edge cases. Should your data be sensitive, ensure it is appropriately anonymised or that appropriate dummy data has been provided. A[ data management plan](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library/rdm/dmp) should be in place and is the responsibility of the project PI. The RSE team can assist you in completing one or advise on certain aspects.

* **Sensitive materials**. It may be that the work will require access to sensitive materials which will require an NDA being in place. Please ensure you consider whether this will be required and take steps as soon as possible to initiate the process so as to avoid delaying the beginning of the project at this stage. As employees of the University of Sheffield, RSE team members are often covered by existing NDAs or research agreements, which are typically between the whole organisation and an external one.


### Use of Version control
All software by RSEs will be managed as a repository using version control software, most likely git. This represents fundamental software engineering best practice and ensures the evolution of the project is captured and allows for navigation through the history of project development which will always be available, even after handover. Any non software activities should utilise tools and storage agreed as part of the kick off meeting.

All our projects will also be shared online via online repository hosting sites (e.g GitHub). This method provides a number of features that aid development, access to materials, collaboration and project management and communication:
* Code is version controlled and saved on redundant storage
* Code is easily accessible by collaborators
* Facilitates collaboration through formal management of contributions.
* Continuous Integration testing improves robustness of contributions
* Provides user friendly task management functionality.
* Communication, planning and task management remains associated with the project.


Repositories hosted online can be made private where necessary. In rare circumstances where the work involves materials that cannot be shared online at all, we will discuss with you and develop more secure custom arrangements.


### Issues and Project Boards {#issues-and-project-boards}

GitHub and GitLab, alongside acting as an online hosting platform for code, also provide a useful set of project management tools. Other cloud based tools such as Jira also provide project management but without close coupling to Issues. Project boards (GitHub, known as issue boards on GitLab) are a useful and efficient way to track the progress of tasks within a project and to prioritise work.

Each task on the project should be described in an 'issue'. Each issue can be assigned a team member, associated with a project milestone and also acts as a discussion thread to communicate over the specifics. Issues don't only have to be used for code, but can be used to track all tasks in a project. Code-related issues can also be associated with pull requests (see below) so that when code is implemented to address an issue, the issue can be automatically closed.


We encourage PIs to engage with the project board during a project, particularly during regular meetings as a way of seeing the progress of the project in one place as well as prioritising tasks.

### Licensing {#licensing}

The RSE team recognises research software as a first class research output and is committed to obtaining maximum value from it via sharing. Options for licensing software should be considered at the earliest opportunity and the default position is that **code should be made available under a permissive open source licence** as it is developed (i.e. right now!), in keeping with the [University of Sheffield Statement on Open Research](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/openresearch/university-statement-open-research).

Exceptions to this include:

* Restrictions on background IP (e.g. the project extends software which cannot be made open source).
* Legal agreements around project funding (e.g. NDAs, ownership of foreground IP is shared under a research agreement)
* Collaborators outside the University of Sheffield will not release copyright.
* The research team has contacted the research services commercialisation team and plans to commercialise the software in a manner that precludes open source licensing.
* The software contains confidential information.


### Contributing to Coding {#contributing-to-coding}

A set of [contribution guidelines](https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/contributing/) should be agreed and held either in the repository or in the project Google Drive.

When code is contributed to a project, it should be committed to the project repository via a git workflow that is agreed by everyone. E.g. It could be committed to its own branch (or fork) and a pull request made against another branch (often `main`, `master` or `dev`).

If you are unfamiliar with the use of version control and collaborative platforms such as GitHub and GitLab and will be contributing code to the project, the RSE(s) collaborating with you will be happy to provide guidance.

Pull requests are a useful tool for discussion of code changes and draft pull requests are often the most efficient place for team members to decide on how best to address an issue.

Team members should agree on a particular process for merging pull requests. Ideally pull requests should use reviewing. However, due to the flexible nature of research software in most cases, it is advisable to merge code even if it is not perfect, as long as it doesn't break an existing feature. This keeps the project from stagnating and improvements can be made later on.

It is advisable to implement testing to ensure that existing features are not broken in development. This can be automated via a continuous integration pipeline which will ensure that code being added to the principal branch functions correctly.


### FAIR Open Access {#fair-open-access}

We strongly prefer outputs that are FAIR open access. [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) means that a research output is **Findable**, **Accessible**, **Interoperable** and **Reusable**. This was initially conceived for data but is in the process of being adapted to research software ([FAIR4RS](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-research-software-fair4rs-wg)).

Making code available via a collaborative version control site such as GitHub is a fantastic step towards realising this. However, additionally pushing software releases to ORDA (preferred for University of Sheffield researchers) or Zenodo confers some important additional benefits:



* Guaranteed long-term archiving
* DOIs for direct citation of software releases (*software releases in this context are snapshots of the source code, and possibly also "builds" or executable files*). A means of [automatically pushing software releases to ORDA](https://github.com/RSE-Sheffield/release_to_ORDA) is being developed.
* Tagging releases with metadata to aid findability

FAIR outputs can lead to more citations and more transparent, trustworthy, research (see [SSI benefits reference list](https://github.com/softwaresaved/useful-references/blob/master/benefits.bib)).

### Sustainability plan - software/data maintenance plan {#sustainability-plan-software-data-maintenance-plan}

RSE effort on a project is for a fixed period of time, usually associated with specific research funding. For software to continue to do its job beyond this scope, ongoing maintenance will be required. Current research funding models do not usually acknowledge this. Bug fixes and updates in dependencies and operating systems, beyond the control of the project, are a key driver of the need for maintenance. As mitigation, prior to starting the project the following should be considered:

* Is the software required to operate after the end of this project?
* If so, who will maintain it? Will they need training within the scope of the project to enable them to do this?
* If so, does it require any infrastructure (e.g. web servers, databases)?
* Consider doing an online [Software Sustainability Review](https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/online-sustainability-evaluation). Not all of the criteria are universal. The project RSE will advise on appropriateness of specific criteria.

As part of your project design you should consider and plan for sustainability. Many research proposals benefit greatly from defining the plans for sustainability within the case for support. 

### Ongoing software maintenance {#ongoing-software-maintenance}

Software maintenance is poorly supported by research funding which is generally for a fixed term. The lifecycle of software and infrastructure/services may very well be expected to run beyond the end of the research project. With respect to software maintenance the use of software best practice plays a vital role in ensuring that your software is maintainable. As part of the development activity on your project you should expect your RSE to leave the code in a state where a future developer is able to contribute in future funding rounds or when maintenance is required. Generally the team tries to work under the assumption that at any period they may need to drop a coding project and it should be possible for another developer to pick up where they left off. This is important for reducing the so-called bus factor of a project and we will work with you to ensure that aspects such as documentation, tests, contribution guidelines and up to date issues are in place. If your code is open source (which we encourage) then ensuring the code has contribution guidelines gives your software the possibility of broader maintenance and feature contributions from the open source community.

As a team we do not take on specific maintenance contracts but if your code has been developed with us or following our guidance we may be able to undertake short pieces of work on code  (subject to staff availability). 


### Infrastructure and Service Maintenance  {#infrastructure-and-service-maintenance}

Similarly to software development the deployment of infrastructure and services (usually web services or cloud infrastructure) are difficult to support beyond the end of a project's funding cycle. We encourage you to consider these factors when proposing your research proposal and plan for how maintenance will be undertaken. All software and services have a lifecycle and it is not feasible to expect them to live persistently forever without an investment in their maintenance. Generally if the development of services or infrastructure is required as an RSE task on a project then we will put in place processes and documentation to ensure you or your researchers are able to perform basic maintenance after our time on a project has finished. It will then be your responsibility to maintain it. Performing updates to dependencies on web services is not something which the team has capacity to undertake. The exception to this is that where we have deployed particular pieces of infrastructure we will engage with IT services to encourage them to run hosted services where there is common demand. This greatly simplifies the maintenance of particular workflows.

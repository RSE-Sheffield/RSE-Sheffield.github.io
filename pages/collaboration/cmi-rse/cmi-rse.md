### RSE support via the Centre for Machine Intelligence (CMI-RSE)

Sheffield's <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/machine-intelligence">Centre for Machine Intelligence (CMI)</A> works closely with the Research Software Engineering (RSE) group in Computer Science. The CMI is funding 1 FTE of research engineering time, enabling RSE to provide AI/ML services without cost recovery. The CMI-RSE team primarily supports members of the University community by enabling, designing, implementing and refining AI streams in research projects.

If you have a project in mind that would benefit from CMI-RSE involvement, please have a look at the FAQ below and complete the application form to register your interest and begin the conversation.

For longer-term projects and those involving a greater degree of AI R&amp;D, please also consider discussing your project with the <a href="https://shef-aire.github.io">CMI AI Research Engineering (AIRE)</a> group.

### Frequently Asked Questions

##### What is on offer?
Project support from one or more research software engineers with AI/ML experience.

##### How much does it cost?
Currently, CMI-RSE provision is free at point-of-use.

##### What are the eligibility criteria?
Any member of the University with an appropriate project is eligible for CMI-RSE support.

##### How will my application be assessed?
Assessments will consider:
* fit with CMI research themes and strategic objectives;
* potential for ''pump-priming'' activity to generate further research and innovation opportunities;
* fit with CMI-RSE skills, experience and interest; and
* project maturity, practicality, barriers, and other project risks.

##### What is the difference between AIRE and CMI-RSE?
With CMI-RSE, projects are shorter-term and focusing on enabling AI/ML within research projects. This could include exploring whether projects could benefit from AI/ML, implementing and optimising AI/ML solutions, and developing best practice software engineering approaches to ensure outputs are well-founded and reproducible. In contrast, the AIRE group delivers longer-term projects with a focus on generating new tools and libraries that feed into a common ecosystem.

##### How do I get in touch?

### Application Process

Please express your interest in accessing CMI-RSE provision by completing the Google Form linked below. We will review applications on an ongoing basis. After this initial review, we will contact you to arrange a scoping meeting to better understand your project requirements and determine timescales and the most appropriate people to involve. Then, at various times throughout the year, projects will be ranked and estimates made concerning RSE availability. At the conclusion of your project a brief post-project report will be required.

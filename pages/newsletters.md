The University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering team curates a monthly newsletter of 
information, activities and events related to research software/computing.  
It typically features information and links to: 
news, interesting blog posts, future events, recent events, job/volunteer opportunities and tutorials.

Let us know if you'd like something to be included in the newsletter by:

* completing [this short form](https://forms.gle/YyQiNjg79tXaLZHq8) (University of Sheffield staff and students) *or* 
* by emailing `rse@sheffield.ac.uk` (for people outside the University)

We can't promise that we'll publish everything that's proposed but 
we are keen to feature submissions from the research community at the University of Sheffield.

Following the Research Software Engineer (RSE) survey carried out last February, we identified a large number of researchers were interested in learning more about improving and understanding the performance of the software they are developing and using in their research.

As part of an [undergraduate research module](https://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/intranet/teaching/public/modules/level4/com4520.html), we are running a pilot study to better understand the current state of research software performance at Sheffield, and we are offering free performance consultations to selected projects.

Our team will assess your software to identify performance bottlenecks, highlight practical optimisation opportunities, and recommend clear next steps. You will receive a short, tailored report summarising our findings. In previous assessments, relatively small changes have led to performance improvements of up to 10x.

Please note:

- Software must be in a working state
- Publication status does not matter
- Software will not be identified in publications without explicit permission
- Machine learning pipelines cannot be assessed at this time

If you would like your software to be considered, please complete our short form, which takes less than three minutes, by **10 April 2026**: https://forms.gle/wc7RX2SsCoe8fJqs8

Spaces are limited as part of this pilot, so we encourage early responses.

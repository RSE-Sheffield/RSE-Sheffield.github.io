## Part 2.1 Expected behaviour

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.
All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person.
In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment
we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all RSE Sheffield activities and platforms:

  - Use welcoming and inclusive language
  - Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
  - Gracefully accept constructive criticism
  - Focus on what is best for the community
  - Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

## Part 2.2 Unacceptable behaviour

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants in any RSE Sheffield
events include:

-   written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people
    on the basis of membership of any specific group
-   causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking,
    following, or intimidation
-   violent threats or language directed against another person
-   the display of sexual or violent images
-   unwelcome sexual attention
-   nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
-   sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
-   insults or put downs
-   sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary
    jokes
-   excessive swearing
-   incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
-   continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or
    recording) with someone after being asked to stop
-   publication of private communication without consent

## Part 2.3 Consequences of Unacceptable behaviour

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are
expected to comply immediately. This applies to any RSE Sheffield events, 
either online or in-person. If a participant engages in
behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the organizers may warn
the offender, ask them to leave the event or platform (without refund),
or engage RSE Sheffield events Code of Conduct Committee to investigate the
Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions.

We have a **[Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/RSE-UoS/signup)** for people involved with research code / software at The University of Sheffield, with a few users not currently staff or students.

The Slack channel is not an approved IT resource for private communications. University of Sheffield staff and students should take rules on protecting personal and research data into account when posting. It's best to consider all posts as public like other types of social media (e.g. Twitter or Facebook). Interactions in the Slack workspace are covered by the [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct).

If you are a University of Sheffield researcher, and have an email address ending in `@sheffield.ac.uk`, you can [join the workspace via this link](https://join.slack.com/t/RSE-UoS/signup). Otherwise, please email [rse@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:rse@sheffield.ac.uk) and ask to join.

Please introduce yourself in the **#general** channel after joining!

The [RSE Society Slack workspace](https://society-rse.org/join-us/) is a better place to connect with the national and international RSE community.

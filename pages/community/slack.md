We have a **Slack workspace** for people involved with research code / software at The University of Sheffield, with a few users not currently staff or students.

The Slack channel is not an approved IT resource for private communications. University of Sheffield staff and students should take rules on protecting personal and research data into account when posting. It's best to consider all posts as public like other types of social media (e.g. Twitter or Facebook). Interactions in the Slack workspace are covered by the [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct).

The [RSE Society Slack workspace](https://society-rse.org/join-us/ is a better place to connect with the national and international RSE community).

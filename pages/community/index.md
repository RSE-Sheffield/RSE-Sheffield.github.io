The RSE group supports research software developers (any researcher who develops software) and research software engineers
across the university through our community activities.
The best way to keep updated on these is to 
join [**RSE Sheffield's Announcements Google Group**](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/rse-group):

The mailing list is for moderated announcements only (not discussion) but
you are welcome to post any announcements which you feel may be of interest to the community
(e.g. training or interesting talks and events)!

The RSE group supports research software developers (any researcher who develops software) and research software engineers
across the university.

The best way to keep updated is to join [**RSE Sheffield's Announcements Google Group**](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/forum/#!forum/rse-group):

We send out regular newsletters with information on events and training, from our team and beyond.

The mailing list is for moderated announcements only (not discussion) but
you are welcome to post any announcements which you feel may be of interest to the community
(e.g. training or interesting talks and events)!

MATLAB
======

MATLAB is a high-level technical computing language and interactive environment for
algorithm development, data visualization, data analysis, and numerical computing.
The University of Sheffield has a Total Academic Headcount license for MATLAB which
allows both staff and students to use it,
both on University and personally owned machines.

  * Download MATLAB from IT Services' [software download site](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/software/)
  * MATLAB documentation for the University's High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters:
      * [Stanage](https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/stanage/software/apps/matlab.html)

NAG Toolbox for MATLAB
----------------------

The NAG Toolbox for MATLAB is the largest and most comprehensive single numerical toolkit that both complements and enhances MATLAB.
The NAG Toolbox for MATLAB contains over 1,500 functions that 
provide solutions to a vast range of mathematical and statistical problems.

  * Download the NAG Toolbox for MATLAB from IT Services' [software download site](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/software/)
  * **Training**: In December 2015, we hosted a training course for the NAG Toolbox for MATLAB.

MATLAB
======

MATLAB is a high-level technical computing language and interactive
environment for algorithm development, data visualization, data
analysis, and numerical computing. The University of Sheffield has a
Total Academic Headcount license for MATLAB which allows both staff and
students to use it, both on University and personally owned machines.

NAG Toolbox for MATLAB
----------------------

The NAG Toolbox for MATLAB is the largest and most comprehensive single
numerical toolkit that both complements and enhances MATLAB. The NAG
Toolbox for MATLAB contains over 1,500 functions that provide solutions
to a vast range of mathematical and statistical problems.

-   Download the NAG Toolbox for MATLAB from IT Services' [software download site](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/software/)
-   **Training**: In December 2015, we hosted a training course for the
    NAG Toolbox for MATLAB. Course materials are available at

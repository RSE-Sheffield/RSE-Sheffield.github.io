**NAG Library**

The NAG [Numerical Algorithms Group] library is a large collection of tried and tested numerical subroutines which may be called from within your own programs. The library is provided in a variety of languages (including MATLAB, C, Fortran and Python) and for a variety of hardware platforms. The University has a full site license for all staff and students.

**NAG Fortran Compiler**

According to the [2015 Fortran UK compiler comparisons](https://www.fortran.uk/fortran-compiler-comparisons/intellinux-fortran-compiler-diagnostic-capabilities/), the NAG compiler was one of the best diagnostic compilers available:  The University has a full site license for all staff and students.

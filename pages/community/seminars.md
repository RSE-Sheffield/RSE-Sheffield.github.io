The RSE group organises seminars and promotes seminars from other groups which are of interest to the community. 
If you have an interesting seminar then announce it on the [mailing-list](/community). 
Below are a number of seminars which are scheduled or have taken place.


We aim to hold lunchtime seminars in the last week of every month, inviting speakers to talk about a wide range of topics that involves practical issues relating to research software.

If you would like to recommend a speaker or would like to give a talk then please [contact us](/contact). We have a budget to support inviting speakers.

*Note: The [GPU computing](http://gpucomputing.shef.ac.uk/seminars/) seminar series has now been merged with the RSE seminar series. Talks on GPU computing will be advertised through both mailing lists.*

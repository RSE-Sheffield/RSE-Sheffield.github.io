**A monthly series of short talks from the research community on research software, data and infrastructure.**

The University has many talks/seminar series centered around research domains
but far fewer on the tools and methods that are of value across research domains.

This is a new monthly series of short talks for those in the research community at TUOS who
work with/write code,
use/manage research data and
use/manage research infrastructure.
We hope through these talks we will come together as a community to discuss best practices and useful methods/tools.

Each LunchBytes session typically features several related short talks on a theme (each being ~10 mins) rather than one longer talk - followed by a discussion.

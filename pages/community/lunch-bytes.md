**A monthly series of short talks from the research community on research software, data and infrastructure.**

The University has many talks/seminar series centered around research domains
but far fewer on the tools and methods that are of value across research domains.

This is a new monthly series of short talks for those in the research community at TUOS who 
work with/write code, 
use/manage research data and 
use/manage research infrastructure
We hope through these talks we as a come together as a community to discuss best practices and useful methods/tools.

For those familiar with the [RSE seminar series](/community/seminars/), LunchBytes has replaced it but is different in flavour: 
each session features several related short talks on a theme (each being ~10 mins) rather than one longer talk.

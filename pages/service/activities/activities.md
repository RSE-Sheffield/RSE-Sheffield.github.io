We would like to collaborate with you to help improve your research
software in a range of areas. Supporting the entire University, we have
collaborators in every faculty and have supported researchers in a range
of subject areas including engineering, mathematics, computer science,
biology, linguistics, physics, chemistry and geography.

## Research Software Engineering

We can help you take your computational workflow to the next level
--making it more automated, robust, open, accessible, user friendly and
reproducible.

## Increasing research impact through software

We believe that it is possible to increase the impact of your research
by leveraging the research software you developed to make it possible.
We can help you make your software open, citable and discoverable.

## Faster code

We can work with you to optimise your code using a range of hardware and
software technologies. R, Python, OpenMP, CUDA, C++, C, Fortran, MATLAB,
Mathematica, and more - we have proven experience in helping researchers
get results more quickly. In some cases, we can provide significant
speed-ups in just a few days.

## GPU computing

We have specialists in GPU computing who can assist you with
accelerating your computational problems using this relatively new
technology. We can also help you learn more about deep learning, the
powerful new machine learning technique that uses GPUs to solve complex
data science problems.

As part of our [GPU computing at University of Sheffield](http://gpucomputing.shef.ac.uk/) initiative,
we have a number of RSE team members who are Deep Learning Institute accredited 
trainers who run courses which aim to teach how to use GPUs
and help you gain access to hardware.

We also specialise in the use of agent based modeling on GPUs using
FLAME or FLAME GPU to perform large scale simulations.

## High Performance Computing (HPC)

We collaborate with a range of partners including CiCS, N8, Archer and
Microsoft to provide you with HPC support on local, regional, national
and cloud-based facilities.

Locally, we assist CiCS in supporting users on their HPC clusters:
Iceberg and ShARC. We are major contributors to their documentation
system and can help you with software installation, training and advice
on how to make maximum use out of these HPC resources that are free to
all members of The University of Sheffield.

We work with the UK National Supercomputing service, Archer as [Archer
Champions](http://www.archer.ac.uk/community/champions/). Our role is to advise users on the access of appropriate
computational resources: and in supporting these users to access and
exploit these resources appropriately.

## Grant support

We have a proven track record in working with PIs to obtain funding for
dedicated Research Software Engineering posts and can offer assistance
to you for your next grant application.

Working with organisations such as the [Software Sustainability
Institute](http://www.software.ac.uk/) and the UK community of [Research Software Engineers](https://rse.ac.uk/), we
engage with funding providers to demonstrate the importance of research
software engineers in modern research.

## Supporting lecturers

We work with University of Sheffield lecturers to assist them in
leveraging modern research software in their teaching.

A recent success story in this area is the work we did with Dr Marta
Milo of the Department of Biomedical Science in the development of the
[BMS353 module](http://opendsi.cc/bioinformatics/). Modern interactive, cloud-based, open-source
technologies were combined with innovative teaching methodologies to
develop a highly successful course.

We give talks and seminars on the use of research software in teaching
-an example of which is the talk on [Project Jupyter and
SageMathCloud](http://mikecroucher.github.io/ChemEng_Jupyter_talk2016/) at the 2016 Chemical Engineering teaching away-day.

## Support of site licensed RSE software

The University of Sheffield's IT department, CiCS, invests heavily in
the provision of best-in-class commercial software applications for the
benefit of the University's students and researchers. We work with CiCS
and software vendors such as Mathworks, Microsoft, Wolfram Research,
Intel, NVIDIA, Maplesoft and NAG to provide training and support to
members of the University to help maximise the impact of these
investments.

# Training, outreach and education

The group is involved in a range of training and outreach activities
including Code Cafe, Software Carpentry and a full module in [Parallel
computing with
GPUs](<http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/intranet/teaching/public/modules/level4/com4521.html>).

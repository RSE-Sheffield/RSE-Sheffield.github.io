Current members of the Research Software Engineering team are listed below. Previous members of the team can be found on our [Alumni](../alumni) page.

# Paul Richmond (Group Director)

Paul is an [EPSRC Research Software Engineering Fellow](https://rse.ac.uk/community/epsrc-rse-fellows/). Paul's career as an academic researcher has always been focused on the development of software to support research, predominantly through the application of emerging hardware architectures to complex systems simulation. His technical expertise in GPU computing has led him to work more broadly, engaging with researchers in a wide range of domains to embed accelerated and GPU computing into their research ecosystems. His background in independent research means that he self-identifies as a [Research Software Engineer](https://rse.ac.uk/) with a strong emphasis on research relating to the application of GPUs. He is the director of the RSE group and oversees and manages team members and their more broad contribution to projects around research software development.

# Mozhgan Kabiri Chimeh

Mozhgan is a Research Associate/Research Software Engineer who specialises in performance acceleration targeting Many-core and Multi-core architectures. She completed her PhD in computer science in 2016 at the University of Glasgow where her area of research was accelerating logic gate circuit simulation targeting heterogeneous architectures.  As part of her PhD project, she optimised and accelerated simulation algorithms and applied them to various parallel architectures (SIMD enabled machines, clusters, and GPUs). She has practical experience with parallel programming using High Performance Computing languages and models including OpenMP and CUDA.

She is currently working on the new version of [FLAMEGPU](http://www.flamegpu.com/) software framework which allows complex systems modelling on GPU architectures.

# Will Furnass

Will is a Research Software Engineer who is curently working on:

  - Workflows and data management for the [Sheffield Biomedical Research Centre](http://sheffieldbrc.nihr.ac.uk/)
  - Research computing strategy and support for the [Insigneo Institute for in silico Medicine](https://insigneo.org/)
  - Software development and code optimisation for [Out Of Our Minds](http://outofourminds.shef.ac.uk/),
    a Leverhume Trust-funded project to "develop new, accurate ways of describing speakers’ linguistic knowledge, by
    using machine-learning techniques that mimic the way in which humans learn".

Previous projects:

  - A [JupyterHub service for the University's ShARC HPC system](http://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/hpc/jupyterhub.html),
    plus training materials that can be delivered using that service
    (the materials relate to [multithreading/multiprocessing using Python](https://github.com/RSE-Sheffield/hi-perf-ipynb).
    Work conducted as part of [OpenDreamKit](https://opendreamkit.org/),
    an EU-funded project to further the computational mathematics ecosystem.

The path to this point has not been particularly direct:
he has a computer science degree,
has worked as a IT systems engineer in the film industry,
has a PhD plus post-doc experience in water engineering
(where he developed semi-physical and data-driven models of water quality in water distribution networks) and
has provided support to the users of the University of Sheffield's high-performance computing clusters.
In addition he has taught or helped run RSE, water engineering and study skills workshops.
His interests include
helping researchers optimise data analysis workflows (primarily using higher-level languages),
providing training in RSE best practices and
systems administration.

He is an accredited [Carpentries instructor](https://carpentries.org/instructors/) and
has facilitated Software and Data Carpentry workshops on topics
including Python, R, version control with Git, the UNIX shell and SQL.

# Anna Krystalli

Anna is a Research Software Engineer. She fell in love with statistical programming and R in particular, during her PhD in Macroecology at the University of Sheffield. This was followed by two years of freelancing as a Research Data Scientist. These and previous experiences as a quality assurance auditor have led her to focus on efforts to promote more transparent, robust, reproducible research through better scientific software development and research data management.

She’s also passionate about community and capacity building. She has extensive teaching experience, was part of the inaugural Mozilla Science Lab [Open Leadership Training](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/readme/) cohort, has been a veteran mentor on following rounds and a member of the organising committee for the [Sheffield R users group](http://sheffieldr.github.io/).

Key interests include:

* All things [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typd)
* Reproducible research
* Open source research technologies and culture enabling next generation open science.

# Peter Heywood

Peter is a Research Software Engineer in the process of completing his PhD at the University of Sheffield.
He specialises in GPU accelerated computing and complex system simulations; including transport network simulation and biological cellular simulations.
He is currently working on the [STriTuVaD project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/212940_en.html)
(a [Horizon2020 project](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/)),
which focuses on the use of in silico trials to support and improve tuberculosis vaccine development.

# Phil Tooley

Phil is a Research Software Engineer and former theoretical and computational physicist, with
particular interest in mathematical modelling, code optimisation and parallelism. He is an
experienced developer of "traditional" parallel HPC codes using MPI and OpenMP in C, C++ and
Fortran, but also champions the use of the Numpy/Scipy stack for scientific computing with python.
This includes the use of accelerator technologies including [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org) and
[Cython](http://cython.org/) to write custom python code which is speed competitive with
traditional compiled languages, possible in conjunction with parallel frameworks such as
[Dask](https://dask.pydata.org/).

She is taking a leave of absence from her astrophysics PhD (where she uses simulations to study the evolution of star clusters) to work on this project.

She is also a [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) fellow and is using the fellowship finds to organise a [series](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/physics/news/programming-skills-sessions) of talks and workshops on a diverse range of topics surrounding best practice.

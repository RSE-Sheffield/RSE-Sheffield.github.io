title: FAIR^2 for research software
layout: page
type: text
---

The FAIR principles were originally developed as guidelines to enhance the reusability of research data. The FAIR
principles apply the concepts of Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability to scholarly data
holdings, and were also intended to be applied to other digital research objects such as algorithms and workflows[^1].

Over the past few years there has been growing recognition that research software, defined as _“source code files,
algorithms, scripts, computational workflows and executables that were created during the research process or for a
research purpose”_[^2], should adhere to FAIR guidelines as well as meeting broader open research goals such as
reproducibility and open access. A modified set of FAIR principles for research software (FAIR4RS), allowing for the
inherent differences between data and software, has been developed to provide a framework for the development of FAIR
research software[^3].

This course offers a modular programme to support researchers in applying FAIR principles and open research practices to
their research software. The overview module provides an introduction to FAIR for research software and gives an
overview of the topics that are offered in more detail in additional modules, which can be selected according to an
individual’s learning goals.

**Target audience**

This course is aimed at researchers, including postgraduate research students, who create code (whether a few scripts or
something more substantial) as part of their research and who want to follow best practices to enhance the FAIRness of
their software.

<!-- Documentation -->
<!-- Reproducible computational environments / Containers -->
<!-- Software publishing/dissemination -->
<!-- DOIs, metadata and citation -->
<!-- Software repositories -->
<!-- Publishing a software paper -->
<!-- Packaging -->

**Prerequisites**

Some experience with developing research software or scripts, for example in Python or R.

**Learning outcomes**

After completing this course, participants should be able to:

- Name the FAIR principles and describe how they apply to research software
- Explain how applying FAIR principles to research software can support open research goals such as transparency,
  reproducibility and reusability
- Identify actions that can be taken at different stages of the research lifecycle to enhance the FAIRness of their
  research software outputs
- Develop a software management plan addressing the intended scope, impact and lifespan of research software
- Describe different types of software licence and discuss their potential implications for reuse of research software,
  including commercialisation
- Apply best practices for scientific software development including design, version control, testing, continuous
  integration and documentation
- Associate their research software with a unique and persistent identifier and use metadata to enhance its findability,
  accessibility and reusability
- Identify repositories that provide long-term persistent storage for research software
- Apply approaches such as packaging and containers to enhance the reusability and reproducibility of research software.

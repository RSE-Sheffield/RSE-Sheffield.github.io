## Sheffield Data Science and AI Community

The [Sheffield Data Science and AI Community](https://sheffieldai.github.io/) connects researchers with an interest inData Science and Artificial Intelligence across the University of Sheffield. 

## Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Training

In addition to training run by the RSE Team on [Deep Learning](../courses/Intro_DL.md), our colleagues in [IT Services][its] offer a range of [free training courses][its-courses] which include topics on Machine Learning.

## Online Deep Learning Resource

You can find a list of free Deep Learning resources accessible online below. While not comprehensive, it should provide a good introduction to the field.

If you would like to contribute to the list, please get in touch with Twin at [t.karmakharm@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:t.karmakharm@sheffield.ac.uk)

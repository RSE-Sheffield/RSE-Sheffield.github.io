**Date: 28th November 2018**

**Time: 9am-4pm**

**Location: Computer Room 4 (Room 2.06), 2nd Floor, The Diamond, University of Sheffield, 32 Leavygreave Road, Sheffield, S3 7RD**

The [Research Software Engineering Sheffield (RSES)](http://rse.shef.ac.uk/) is pleased to announce that we are holding a free one-day practical introduction to Deep Learning workshop on the **28th of November**. The course is sponsored by NVIDIA and will be delivered through their [Deep Learning Institute](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/education/) program by [Twin Karmakharm](/contact/team#twin) (accredited DLI instructor). The event is open to staff and students from all faculties.

In this full-day workshop, you will learn the basics of deep learning by training and deploying neural networks. Build the skill-set and toolbox you need to build your own deep learning solutions through hands-on projects. Learners will:

* Understand general terms and background of deep learning
* Implement common deep learning workflows such as Image Classification and Object Detection
* Manipulate training parameters to improve accuracy
* Modify internal layers of neural networks to adapt to new problems
* Deploy your networks to start solving real-world problems

**Content level:** Beginner

**Pre-requisites:** Technical background and basic understanding of deep learning concepts. Knowledge of Python is helpful but is not a requirement.

**Platforms:** [Nvidia DIGITS](https://developer.nvidia.com/digits) and [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)

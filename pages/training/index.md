People working with code for research, whether they are writing their first script to managing a complex software project need skills that academic training might not provide. The RSE Team's aspiration is that all researchers who need these skills should be given the opportunity to learn them, either from the RSE Team, our University of Sheffield colleagues or other sources.

### Regular RSE Team Training

The RSE Team focusses on training in version control as this is a key skill for reproducible research and collaborative software development. We also offer training in Deep Learning to improve and facilitate update of AI. These courses are run on a regular basis. If there are not courses currently advertised, check back soon, or [join our mailing](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/rse-group) list to find out when new courses are advertised.

### IT Services Training

Our colleagues in [IT Services][its] offer a range of [free training courses][its-courses]. This is a good place to look if you want to learn how to code, but there are a wide range of other courses there as well.

### Responsive RSE Team Training

The RSE Team run training in response to the needs of groups of researchers. However, we usually need to seek funding from an organisation, department, research group, institute or doctoral training centre. The costs of running a course are our [staff time][service] plus venue and infrastructure costs. This allows us to customise or develop new training for specific audiences.  

We have recently run these courses:

- [Reproducible Research Data and Project Management in R](courses/ACCE.md)
- [Contributing to Open Source Software](courses/Open_Source.md)
- [Write better research software (in Python)](courses/good_soft.md)

Our expertise for bespoke training development includes Python, R, MATLAB, Reproducible research, C and C++, git and GitHub, Linux shell, High Performance Computing, GPU Computing, Systems administration inc. Docker and Ansible.

We can run courses where material is made openly available by others (e.g. [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org)).

If you're interested in us running similar courses for your learners, please contact <rse@sheffield.ac.uk>.

### Statement on free at point of use training

We are delighted to be able to make free at point of use training available to the research community, to enable better software and more open, reproducible research. However, **free at point of use training is not free**. The cost of a course can easily run to thousands of pounds, if preparation costs are taken into account.

**If you sign up for a course, please make sure you either attend or cancel your booking.** Bookings can usually be cancelled using [eventbrite.com](https://www.eventbrite.com) or, failing that, by emailing [rse@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:rse@sheffield.ac.uk).

Running courses that are not fully attended wastes our funding (which is provided by taxpayers, charities and students, amongst others) and reduces our collective capacity to improve research outputs and researcher experiences.

Persistent failure to attend booked courses might result in you being excluded from future training opportunities.

[Software Carpentry][soft-carp] and [Data Carpentry][data-carp] are 
training programmes designed to equip researchers 
with the the computing skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain. 
A Carpentry workshop ("bootcamp") is a hands-on, (typically) two-day event that covers 
the core computing skills needed to be productive in a small research team. 
Short tutorials alternate with practical exercises, and 
all instruction is done via live coding.

As such we have a number of qualified Carpentry instructors with the ability to train a number of new instructors each year. 
Carpentry events and instructor training are jointly organised by a working group formed of members of:

* RSE Sheffield
* the [Sheffield Bioinformatics Core Facility][bio-inf-core]
* the [Library][library]
* [CiCS][cics]

## Planned Carpentry Events

We are currently planning our next series of Software and Data Carpentry workshops.

Details for these events will be posted on this page and shared via the [RSE announcement mailing list][announce-mail-list].

## Current Certified Instructors

* [Mark Dunning][mark-dunning](Sheffield Bioinformatics Core)
* [Will Furnass][will-furnass] (RSE Sheffield)
* [Katju≈°a Koler][kat-koler](SITraN)
* [Anna Krystalli][anna-krystalli](RSE Sheffield)

### Becoming an Instructor

The [Festival of the Mind](https://festivalofthemind.sheffield.ac.uk/2020/) is an annual festival hosted by the University of Sheffield with the aim of bringing together academics, professionals and the public to bring research to life. The 2020 festival featured the [Futurecade](https://festivalofthemind.sheffield.ac.uk/2020/futurecade/) which showcased work using virtual reality and environments. One such project was simulating crowd responses to flooding. The work titled [Planning for the Next Great Flood](https://festivalofthemind.sheffield.ac.uk/2020/futurecade/planning-for-the-next-great-flood/) was led by research student Mohammad Shirvani.

The University of Sheffield's [RSE team](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/) provided technical advice and software engineering support. The simulation was built using [FLAMEGPU](http://www.flamegpu.com/), an agent based modelling framework by the Sheffield RSE team which simplifies leveraging high performance GPUs. Advice was given on implementation using FLAMEGPU, and the RSE team's developer integrated the simulation with a custom visualisation using Unreal Engine 4.

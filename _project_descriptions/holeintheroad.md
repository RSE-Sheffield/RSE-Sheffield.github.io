The [Festival of the Mind](https://digitalmedia.sheffield.ac.uk/media/Festival+of+the+Mind+2016/1_0n59ye7o) is an annual festival hosted by the University of Sheffield with the aim of bringing together academics, professionals and the public to bring research to life. The 2016 festival featured the [Virtual Hole in the Road](https://digitalmedia.sheffield.ac.uk/media/The+Virtual+Hole+in+the+Road/1_lgoq4e7q) exhibit, which showcased a virtual reality recreation of the much loved "Hole in the Road", a former open-air underground complex set beneath a roundabout in Sheffield.

The University of Sheffield's [Visual Computing group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/visual-computing) and [RSE team](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/) worked to provide virtual reality and software development expertise, bringing the 3D model created by [Human](https://humanstudio.com/) to life. The project was incredibly popular with the public and has been used as a demonstration of the VR technology many times since its initial presentation at the Festival of the Mind in 2016.

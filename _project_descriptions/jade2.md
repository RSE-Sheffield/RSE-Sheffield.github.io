JADE II was a GPU-based, deep Learning focused, Tier-2 HPC service associated with 19 academic partners including Sheffield.
JADE II was decommissioned on 2025-01-06.
JADE II was the successor of the [JADE](http://www.jade.ac.uk/) system, which was decommissioned in 2021.

RSES has been a local institutional contact and has been involved in
promoting the system,
managing user access and
on-boarding,
and has provided on-going technical support and training.

In order to train users and promote the use of the system,
RSES have created an [Introduction to Deep Learning Course](https://rses-dl-course.github.io/),
a one-day mixture of theoretical lectures and practical labs in Python and R.

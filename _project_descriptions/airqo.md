[AirQo](https://www.airqo.net) makes use of "low cost" air quality sensors to increase the coverage of air quality montioring in Kampala, Uganda. It applies machine learning methods to data to better inform descision making. Its mission to to provide this technology to other cities in sub-saharan Africa.

AirQo has a strong team of academics and software engineers, mostly based at Makerere University in Kampala, but with some at the University of Sheffield and elsewhere. University of Sheffield RSE involvement is helping with software quality in the implementation of cutting edge machine learning methods developed by researchers within live "production" web software, hosted in the cloud. This is achieved through engagement with AirQo's Scrum (agile) project management approach.

AirQo shares its code via its [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/airqo-platform). In addition to live air quality data, [blog posts](https://www.airqo.net/blog) describe some recent milestones.

The project outputs are hoped to include improved decisions based on newly available air quality data and information derived from machine learning. Ultimately this will improve air quality and health in Kampala and other African cities.
